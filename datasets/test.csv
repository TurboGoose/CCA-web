odrisck,2015-01-01T03:03:41.401Z,"@Lumiras will you log out of FCC please, clear your browsers cache and log back in with something other than github, let me know if the issue remains please"
terakilobyte,2015-01-01T03:03:53.579Z,"get there faster in the air, and dissuade tailgaters on the ground"
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:04:04.112Z,"odrisck, will do. I'll try doing it via a different browser too"
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:04:29.972Z,"oh, I guess I should use @odrisck and such :+1: "
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:04:31.633Z,"that would be great thank you, its a known bug we are working on, I apologize for the inconvenience"
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:04:43.564Z,:)
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:05:11.984Z,"@odrisck it's no problem, I just got a little freaked out when there was a Polish man's picture where mine was supposed to be :smile: "
Kadams223,2015-01-01T03:05:27.413Z,@odrisck ok will try that thanks again
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:05:30.115Z,I can imagine :)
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:05:35.708Z,no problem @Kadams223 :)
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:08:01.400Z,"@odrisck just logged in via Facebook on a different browser, same issue"
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:08:38.185Z,"interesting, thank you, I’ll let Quincy know"
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:09:47.132Z,"@odrisck sounds good...is that just a placeholder or something, or did someone else's info get loaded into my account somehow?"
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:10:40.492Z,"no, there is an issue we are having with the github login, I’m sure its just confused and thinks you are that guy, Quincy will be on it as soon as he can"
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:11:31.254Z,when did you join FCC @Lumiras ?
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:12:42.216Z,"@odrisck today, thought I'd get a good start on the new year :)"
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:13:13.224Z,"thats fantastic, do you have a programming background or is this a career shift for you?"
BGRicker,2015-01-01T03:14:45.525Z,"Howdy, I'm new here"
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:14:57.482Z,hi there @BGRicker welcome to our community
BGRicker,2015-01-01T03:15:07.826Z,"Hey, thanks!"
trisell,2015-01-01T03:15:12.038Z,Same here...stumbled upon it via reddit today. It's at the top of r/javascript
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:15:23.654Z,welcome aboard @trisell 
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:15:34.271Z,"It's a career shift. I've been out of college for about 6 years now on a film production degree, and the only work I've ended up getting is really awful office stuff, so I've been studying front end development and graphic design for the past six months and really want to get serious about getting a job doing web development in 2015"
BGRicker,2015-01-01T03:15:37.602Z,Do you know if this is only javascript? 
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:15:40.516Z,welcome @BGRicker 
BGRicker,2015-01-01T03:15:51.931Z,Thanks!
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:16:15.329Z,"we are JS focused, MEAN stack, at the moment"
trisell,2015-01-01T03:16:39.066Z,So how many different non-profit projects are there right now?
BGRicker,2015-01-01T03:16:41.700Z,"Oh, that's great, thank you. I know a good amount of ruby/rails, but am definitely looking to learn MEAN."
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:17:02.915Z,"quite a few, I’ll check for a count, but we are getting contacted daily"
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:17:46.096Z,"I coundt 14 that have been greenlit, I don’t have a count of how many are waiting "
trisell,2015-01-01T03:18:51.324Z,"Oh sweet. That's what has been the hardest for me to find. I can blow through the tutorials, code academy and such, but getting actual hands on experience coding has been problematic.. I usually just feel like a leaf blown around by the wind because I really  don't know where to go or what to start doing after finishing the tutorials."
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:19:40.204Z,its exciting for sure 
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:19:48.002Z,"@trisell I'm the same way. After I finish some tutorials, I'm like ""ok, now how do I actually make something?""...projects will be really fun!"
trisell,2015-01-01T03:21:51.197Z,"Yeah I lack a certain amount of artsy creativity, I'm more of a here's what we need, make it happen kinda guy..So coming up with my own project is troublesome for me..."
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:23:09.327Z,"if anyone is interested ever, message me, I have links for project ideas for your portfolio"
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:23:58.480Z,"Hello World, and happy new year! Looking forward to starting this course!"
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:24:10.216Z,welcome @seancrwhite!
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:24:23.732Z,ty @Lumiras :D
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:24:44.395Z,Hello there @seancrwhite welcome to our community
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:25:12.269Z,@trisell the way I got into learning JavaScript was by sort of lying to someone about my JS knowledge when I was building their website by telling them I could build them this real-time calculator thing
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:25:29.802Z,and then you went and learned how to do it
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:25:35.818Z,"yeah, thats how we all get going :)"
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:25:40.222Z,exactly! and it turned out really nice
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:25:46.561Z,"That's how I got started, too"
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:25:55.593Z,"I had the help of an awesome dev I found on Reddit, too"
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:26:08.920Z,"it puts a good fire under your butt, gives you the inspiration to actually learn"
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:26:39.907Z,"@seancrwhite totally, and I was like ""you're paying me waaaay too much money for me to screw this up"" :)"
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:27:45.230Z,"Haha yeah, I had a ton of stress and nightmares about messing it up, but I came out with enough knowledge to create a basic business site"
trisell,2015-01-01T03:27:49.569Z,"Yeah, I have a very small non-profit that I just took over the website for, that is what partially drove me into it, also I see web dev as the primary method of consumption in the future. Why build programs that install on somebody's computer when I can run things in the browser, and have the same hardware access, but far more control over the use/updating of my product."
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:28:12.878Z,@trisell I agree
trisell,2015-01-01T03:28:15.576Z,"I'm in systems administration right now, and even we are being forced to code."
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:28:34.607Z,Code is the future
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:28:50.828Z,and I for one welcome our new robot overlords
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:28:54.642Z,lol
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:28:57.740Z,JS is the future
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:29:44.483Z,"I plan to build our new robot overlords btw, so put in your requests now"
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:29:55.105Z,for how you would like skynet to be
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:30:00.796Z,"@trisell with the diversity of devices we're using to access data these days, companies aren't going to want to code separate apps for Windows/OSX/iOS/Android/Kindle/Toasters when they could just develop an awesome responsive website or app and call it a day"
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:30:29.429Z,yes
BGRicker,2015-01-01T03:30:50.213Z,My only skynet request is to have it make the perfect pizza
trisell,2015-01-01T03:31:11.262Z,Everything short of nukes and guns...I don't really want to have to live a dystopian existence in the future. I'm not that much of a Hunger Games fan.
odrisck,2015-01-01T03:31:40.644Z,thats a given :)
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:31:43.739Z,"@trisell I mean, at least it's exciting :)"
trisell,2015-01-01T03:32:36.161Z,I like showers and warm meals. I've lived on a diet of MRE's before...it's not really all it's cracked up to be in the movies.
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:38:21.149Z,@trisell well coding will ensure you a healthy diet of Taco Bell and Mountain Dew for sure :)
DSrupt,2015-01-01T03:38:41.482Z,Some of the links are behind a pay wall. Is that normal?
DSrupt,2015-01-01T03:39:07.581Z,like http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/46
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:39:17.148Z,Pay wall? 
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:39:46.811Z,@DSrupt I'm not getting any kind of paywall message
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:40:02.449Z,I am
DSrupt,2015-01-01T03:40:02.493Z,I can't see the video. Hmm.
BGRicker,2015-01-01T03:40:02.982Z,You may need to sign up for a CodeSchool account
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:40:10.432Z,enroll now to play :(
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:40:18.719Z,and I thought this whole thing was free
DSrupt,2015-01-01T03:40:19.012Z,^ yep
zmickler,2015-01-01T03:40:29.505Z,Hello World!
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:40:35.627Z,Hello!
DSrupt,2015-01-01T03:40:39.642Z,Hi!
BGRicker,2015-01-01T03:40:57.877Z,"Ahhh, I think CodeSchool might have had that video be free for a while, they have intros to stuff be free and then the more advanced videos cost money. It's a great service though, I just bought the full year for about $180 on Black Friday"
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:41:11.587Z,Yeah it looks like that part IS behind a paywall
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:41:13.483Z,BUT
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:41:29.049Z,You should be able to learn that subject elsewhere by googling it
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:41:39.468Z,it might take more effort and more time though :(
terakilobyte,2015-01-01T03:42:03.830Z,"sorry, what subject is behidn a paywall?"
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:42:09.701Z,ExpressJS
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:42:21.495Z,Just one little bit of the whole thing
trisell,2015-01-01T03:42:35.721Z,"ALso If you are that far along, you could pay the $30 bucks as an investment on your future."
terakilobyte,2015-01-01T03:42:39.731Z,"Ah. I believe there’s an option for a “hall pass"""
DSrupt,2015-01-01T03:42:52.754Z,I'll just use teamtreehouse. Thanks y'all
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T03:42:52.818Z,does that discount the price?
trisell,2015-01-01T03:43:55.569Z,https://www.codeschool.com/hall_passes/f13d3c3e1f66/claim_shared'
trisell,2015-01-01T03:43:59.064Z,Hall Pass link
trisell,2015-01-01T03:44:03.615Z,2 free days.
terakilobyte,2015-01-01T03:44:26.015Z,"however, if you’re that far along, I might also recommend looking into a book titled “Mean Web Development” by the original author of the popularized MEAN stack and who maintains the MEANJS stack. The e-edition is cheaper than a month of code school, and obviously the book covers a lot more"
DSrupt,2015-01-01T03:45:57.373Z,"Thanks @terakilobyte, I'll look into it."
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:46:20.223Z,"There's also this for a $9 first month...it's an affiliate link, not from me, I found it on some random site: https://www.codeschool.com/enrollments/cVZvdEsyVUw2TE1nWW9VMWI1aFBocVZwUVoxR25QVmhxZ0s4dExob2k1VT0tLWpoZnd1cGczSlpKcllFWXQveUdsQ3c9PQ==?utmr=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fbit.ly%252FNineDollarTrial%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNGEmnH3yitRjxQjhpfYam0HRkiqWg"
terakilobyte,2015-01-01T03:48:37.690Z,"Alternatively, and a completely viable option, is to visit [this forum post](http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/hello-bookmarks/73) and integrate some of the links into your own bookmarks. Mongoose, Express, and Angular have excellent free tutorials on their respective websites. Nodeschool.io is a great place to go to learn about node more in depth."
Lumiras,2015-01-01T03:49:39.358Z,"The CodeSchool tutorial on Angular is pretty good and is 100% free, Google is footing the bill on that one"
Lumiras,2015-01-01T04:01:55.384Z,"Well, see you all later, have a great new year!"
trisell,2015-01-01T04:03:58.150Z,Happy New Year!!!
odrisck,2015-01-01T04:04:04.144Z,Happy New Year :)

odrisck,2015-01-01T04:11:25.652Z,what what
Harames,2015-01-01T04:11:45.409Z,Comcast doubled our internet speed for free! 
sevenstreak,2015-01-01T04:14:29.390Z,What?!
odrisck,2015-01-01T04:14:35.567Z,wow
odrisck,2015-01-01T04:14:37.145Z,nice
sevenstreak,2015-01-01T04:15:08.985Z,How'd you make that happen?
Harames,2015-01-01T04:15:42.873Z,"Yeah, we were paying for 25 Mbps and they doubled everyone in the neighborhoods internet. So now we are getting around 50 Mbps. "
sevenstreak,2015-01-01T04:17:03.805Z,Sweet! Wish my comcast deal was as generous.
Harames,2015-01-01T04:21:53.081Z,The only problem is everyone is using the internet so it keeps going up and down.
trisell,2015-01-01T04:22:39.964Z,So you really have a 50Mbps pipe that you are forced to share with the whole neighborhood...that's sad...but exciting because now you have more pipe to share!!!!!
Harames,2015-01-01T04:24:33.442Z,"No I get 50 Mbps, we almost never have internet shortages. It is probably because it is new years and everyone is streaming videos."
trisell,2015-01-01T04:26:09.490Z,Ah cool.

mjcCodes,2015-01-01T05:46:48.307Z,LOVED it.

mjcCodes,2015-01-01T05:51:43.855Z,"@trisell I think if you're pairing with someone, you two can find a good solution. I've used Skype's screen sharing features with success. "
trisell,2015-01-01T05:52:01.625Z,That would work as well. 
mjcCodes,2015-01-01T05:53:17.270Z,"alright everyone, off the computer till next year. Have a super evening! "
RussEby,2015-01-01T05:53:19.765Z,"Or do a Google Group. That's what they've been using at CodeBuddies, works well with small groups."

hallfox,2015-01-01T06:40:06.602Z,@PrimitiveLogic  What kind of issues are you having?
RussEby,2015-01-01T06:40:20.073Z,"Instead of using the function, isn't the point to random select a point of the array and inserting the word fizzify?"
4TSG4X,2015-01-01T06:40:40.692Z,"Yes, that is correct."
hallfox,2015-01-01T06:40:44.828Z,"@PrimitiveLogic  Or rather, could you elaborate on your problem? I don't understand what you're asking."
4TSG4X,2015-01-01T06:40:46.505Z,I have no idea as to how to do that.
RussEby,2015-01-01T06:40:55.797Z,Right now all it's returning is num.
4TSG4X,2015-01-01T06:41:08.522Z,I have to select a random point in the array and return 'fizzify'.
hallfox,2015-01-01T06:41:09.340Z,Use array indexing?
4TSG4X,2015-01-01T06:41:22.137Z,No idea how to do that.
RussEby,2015-01-01T06:41:27.869Z,arr[num] would select the point in the array
hallfox,2015-01-01T06:41:43.434Z,"arr[num] = ""fizzify"""

"
hallfox,2015-01-01T06:46:08.501Z,@PrimitiveLogic  I'd just rewrite `fizzify` as:

        var num = Math.floor(Math.random() * n);

4TSG4X,2015-01-01T07:01:14.580Z,Just not on the website.
RussEby,2015-01-01T07:01:56.447Z,I did notice that you have it start at 0. Most of the fizz buzz starts at 1. Did you want it to start at 0?
4TSG4X,2015-01-01T07:03:28.713Z,"Yeah I started it at one, check the code I just gave you."
4TSG4X,2015-01-01T07:03:35.461Z,I fixed that shortly after.

iyeager2004,2015-01-01T16:46:05.207Z,Rose Parade? Did you happen to see the tornado down there yesterday?
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T16:49:22.782Z,"Also, Happy New Years everyone. Starting my jQuery tutorial's this morning. Excited to learn the JS stuff. I'd love to figure out how to tie my .NET and Python/PHP background in with the MEAN stack."
seancrwhite,2015-01-01T16:51:35.338Z,Good Morning everyone and happy new year
StevenKW,2015-01-01T16:53:06.820Z,@iyeager2004 I did see that mini tornado.
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T16:54:53.437Z,"I thought the frost up in norcal was weird, but it's snowing and tornadoes down south. That's some Day After Tomorrow stuff."
odran037,2015-01-01T16:56:10.817Z,"Wow, I haven't been on here since last year!"
odran037,2015-01-01T16:56:17.482Z,ba dum tss... :)
devstan,2015-01-01T16:56:22.759Z,.....
odran037,2015-01-01T16:56:32.257Z,"Sorry, haven't had my coffee yet"
devstan,2015-01-01T16:56:48.279Z,"I was like damn, welcome back and then i realized"
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T16:56:49.548Z,@odran037 Nice. I see what you did there.
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T16:57:09.962Z,"Okay, enough yapping, I'm getting to work, talk at you all later."
odran037,2015-01-01T16:57:18.157Z,haha! Later!

jsonify,2015-01-01T17:14:49.177Z,How is everyone doing on their pair programming? 
StevenKW,2015-01-01T17:16:31.636Z,Haven't paired yet... Do you recommend pairing before getting to the pairing exercises?
devstan,2015-01-01T17:17:29.962Z,"No idea where you guys are talking about, new here."
JMCQ87,2015-01-01T17:17:57.142Z,"I am still re-freshing what I already did before, some longer time ago outside of FCC, with all the early exercises. Probably will need a week or two for that, at least."
JMCQ87,2015-01-01T17:18:07.640Z,also hello everyone ;)
devstan,2015-01-01T17:18:13.874Z,Hello!

JMCQ87,2015-01-01T17:22:20.539Z,nice ^^
davisec52,2015-01-01T17:23:20.972Z,"@iheartkode yes, I also traditionally pass into the new year sound asleep."
iheartkode,2015-01-01T17:24:03.495Z,I am usually awake but I am older and ate too much..
QuincyLarson,2015-01-01T17:24:13.179Z,Good morning. Happy New Year!
davisec52,2015-01-01T17:24:25.275Z,Happy New Year!

JMCQ87,2015-01-01T17:25:07.678Z,"I just watched a movie with several parts all night, only switched the channel for a few minutes around midnight to see some fireworks. ;)"
deamme,2015-01-01T17:26:09.553Z,When do I need to pair up? :worried: 
iheartkode,2015-01-01T17:26:24.306Z,You pair at a certain point in the challenges.
devstan,2015-01-01T17:26:32.087Z,Oh.
JMCQ87,2015-01-01T17:27:10.500Z,"Anyways, back to work and then to some sports for me... ttyl everyone"
StevenKW,2015-01-01T17:27:25.619Z,"Winter Classic is soon!

deamme,2015-01-01T17:27:33.752Z,@iheartkode Thanks

devstan,2015-01-01T17:28:27.135Z,"ima play some chivalry medieval warfare and chat at the same time :)
"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-01T17:28:32.649Z,@deamme There’s no need to pair until you reach challenge 34
N0FJ,2015-01-01T17:30:29.994Z,Hello & Happy New Year everyone! 
devstan,2015-01-01T17:32:08.769Z,Happy New Year! :D
jsonify,2015-01-01T17:33:11.039Z," @stevenkw I suspect that once you've gotten to that 34th challenge, you'll be itching to apply what you've learned on some more logical problems. Pairing is a great way for both people to advance their skills "
StevenKW,2015-01-01T17:34:45.948Z,I am starting a part time PHP job on Monday so I am taking a PHP detour this week. This means I am not going to get many challenges done.
JonathanAaron,2015-01-01T17:36:24.643Z,I'm looking forward to getting started with these challenges!
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T17:39:14.414Z,"In general, how long should we plan on working or studying per day? Just a rough estimate from people who've done it already."
StevenKW,2015-01-01T17:44:01.686Z,@iyeager2004 It depends on your free time. Or available time.
StevenKW,2015-01-01T17:45:36.116Z,As long as you make progress each day I think you are doing well. 
StevenKW,2015-01-01T17:45:54.872Z,so 30 minutes to 12 hours a day :) 
StevenKW,2015-01-01T17:47:13.649Z,I shoot for two hours minimum but like to get six hours.
StevenKW,2015-01-01T17:49:03.919Z,I use http://www.tomighty.org/ and work in 4 tomato sets.
devstan,2015-01-01T17:51:51.525Z,Installing it right now. Thanks for the tip.
StevenKW,2015-01-01T17:56:43.796Z,OK time for the [Winter Classic](http://www.nbcsports.com/hockey/nhl/nationals-park-ready-2015-winter-classic)!
vimalkurup,2015-01-01T18:05:19.447Z,I'm experiencing an issue with FreeCodeCamp Github signup. Where do I report this ?. I already tried @FreeCodeCamp
devstan,2015-01-01T18:07:05.071Z,You should fill in real information about yourself.
devstan,2015-01-01T18:07:12.752Z,Your own e-mail.
vimalkurup,2015-01-01T18:11:21.905Z,"Okay so this is the issue; I tried to logging in with Github. Instead of taking me to the ""authorize app"" page, I got logged into an account created randomly. The user icon, the name and location shown on the profile page is not mine. When I delete this account and try again, I get logged in with another set of random user details."
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:13:06.072Z,Good morning and Happy New Year CodeCampers
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:14:41.697Z,"@iyeager2004 FCC is geared towards busy people, you can take it in small manageable chunks, an hour at a time is perfectly fine, any goal you set for yourself beyond that is gravy!"
devstan,2015-01-01T18:15:08.487Z,Weird you could try to change all the user information and make it your own account.
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:16:54.184Z,"@netchaos thank you for the headsup, this is a known issue, we are tracking it. Is it possible for you to log in with twitter or facebook instead?"
devstan,2015-01-01T18:17:08.000Z,Oh that's the issue dumb me.
vimalkurup,2015-01-01T18:17:11.251Z,"Yeah I could do that, in fact I created an account using Twitter login. But I'm trying to report this issue to the devs do that they could fix this."
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:17:21.234Z,I’m the person to report to :)
vimalkurup,2015-01-01T18:17:22.779Z,Okay cool.
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:17:28.921Z,"thank you, we do apologize for the inconvenience"
deamme,2015-01-01T18:17:32.474Z,Try clear the browser cache? @netchaos 
vimalkurup,2015-01-01T18:17:45.813Z,"No worries, just wanted to help."
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:17:55.921Z,I appreciate it :)
Krazem,2015-01-01T18:19:24.186Z,Hi guys please tell me im quite noob too all this programming stuff is this a good way too learn from scratch?? :)
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:19:41.683Z,this is an excellent way to learn from scratch @Krazem 
Krazem,2015-01-01T18:20:06.618Z,thanks odrisck :D
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:20:16.204Z,"every member of the FCC team is dedicated to helping in anyway we can, so please come ask for help, we’ll pair up with you as well to walk you through things you are finding difficult"
Krazem,2015-01-01T18:20:55.447Z,thats good too know :clap: 
kbarfoot,2015-01-01T18:21:02.816Z,"hi ppl, happy new year, just starting out so a bit green, any ideas why this code line wnt work? background: #000 url(<a href=""http://imgur.com/imIT4""><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/imIT4.jpg"" title=""source: imgur.com"" /></a>"");"

"
devstan,2015-01-01T18:21:40.919Z,The a and the img tag isnt needed
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:21:44.655Z,yes because you need to specify those things seperate. background-image: url
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:21:54.155Z,so make your color on one line
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:21:58.054Z,and do a second line for the img
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:22:08.621Z,oh yes and the a isn’t needed
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:22:10.229Z,heh
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:22:17.910Z,didn’t even get that far
devstan,2015-01-01T18:22:32.478Z,haha
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:23:09.312Z,here is one I have up right now for a project I’m working on
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:23:10.077Z,"body {
	background:white;
  background-image: url('background.png');
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;"
devstan,2015-01-01T18:25:41.092Z,Before i joined FCC i already did all the things on Dash. So I was like shit I already did all this.
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:25:50.084Z,oh nice
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:26:02.593Z,I enjoyed dash more than what we had up there before
devstan,2015-01-01T18:26:11.540Z,"Oh, why?
"
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:26:30.980Z,"actual projects, so while you learn you are actually producing something tangible"
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:26:36.288Z,and the robot was fun :)
devstan,2015-01-01T18:26:43.647Z,"Yep, it was."
devstan,2015-01-01T18:26:52.790Z,The rich dancing guy.
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:27:04.276Z,I like that it gets people thinking about the flexibility of css 
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:27:42.081Z,I’m all for as few images as possible on my pages
devstan,2015-01-01T18:28:08.531Z,"Joined today at FCC! :)

odrisck,2015-01-01T18:28:16.861Z,welcome to our community :)
devstan,2015-01-01T18:28:21.036Z,Thanks!
devstan,2015-01-01T18:28:31.886Z,"Already love it, this chat thing is awesome"
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:29:02.464Z,"yeah, its pretty awesome :)"
devstan,2015-01-01T18:29:32.398Z,"Going to get a drink, brb."

odrisck,2015-01-01T18:40:55.131Z,"heh had to go check the bathroom skylight, my daughter thought it was leaking"
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:41:30.493Z,"also I’m happy to report, I am in love with bulletproof coffee"
devstan,2015-01-01T18:41:54.896Z,"bulletproof coffee?

deamme,2015-01-01T18:42:09.943Z,Can't really get dash to accept my work.. http://i.imgur.com/RyPaPoY.png
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:42:30.543Z,"yeah, coffee with coconut oil and butter then put in the blender"
devstan,2015-01-01T18:42:40.725Z,ah
devstan,2015-01-01T18:43:21.832Z,I don't see anything wrong.
devstan,2015-01-01T18:43:31.111Z,let me check my Dash.
deamme,2015-01-01T18:43:39.198Z,thanks @devstan 
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:44:13.967Z,what about your border radisu on the torso
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:44:18.829Z,border-radius:
knikki,2015-01-01T18:44:23.825Z,"@odrisck From what little I've seen here in the last 20 seconds, I take it you're the person to talk with about FCC site issues?"
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:44:40.911Z,yes thats me
devstan,2015-01-01T18:45:01.145Z,border-radius: 20px 20px 100px 100px; might need to be this
emultia,2015-01-01T18:45:09.398Z,hello world!
deamme,2015-01-01T18:45:15.915Z,@devstan okay thanks
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:45:18.319Z,welcome aboard @emultia 
knikki,2015-01-01T18:45:29.751Z,"I just set up an account and was logged in as someone else. A Google search revealed this is known, but do I need to worry about others being logged in as myself?"
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:45:32.559Z,your foot is also missing some things
devstan,2015-01-01T18:45:37.083Z,Could also be another thing that I added in later lessons @deamme 
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:46:05.291Z,"no your account information is safe, its an authentication issue between github and FCC, are you able to log in using twitter or facebook?"
devstan,2015-01-01T18:46:22.561Z,What? @odrisck I don't see any difference between my Dash?
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:47:08.915Z,"I’m looking at my completed robot, I just noticed which checkpoint and the issue is likely with the torso :)"
knikki,2015-01-01T18:47:15.312Z,"I was able to log in fine with my Google account, and I revoked access for FCC through GitHub. I just wasn't sure if I should be concerned about my own information."
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:48:28.236Z,"awesome, thank you @knikki, your information is safe"
knikki,2015-01-01T18:48:46.965Z,Thanks for the reassurance. :)
devstan,2015-01-01T18:49:48.248Z,@deamme is it fixed?
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:49:52.722Z,"I’m glad to help :), the reason we use the log in process we do is so we don’t directly have your information, its some issue with github authentication, I can imagine its disturbing to see someone elses name there :)"
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:49:58.709Z,I use twitter to login so I hadn’t seen it
deamme,2015-01-01T18:49:58.723Z,"I we wrote my code, and somehow it fixed it.."
deamme,2015-01-01T18:50:06.810Z,rewrote*
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:50:15.699Z,"awesome, sometimes that happens @deamme "
devstan,2015-01-01T18:50:18.811Z,"@deamme Sometimes that fixes my code too, i think it's a bug"
knikki,2015-01-01T18:52:17.420Z,"It was a bit disturbing, especially since it was a gentleman that lives in my town. He didn't seem particularly active on the site, so there was nothing to mess with. :D"
odrisck,2015-01-01T18:52:39.136Z,lol
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T19:00:40.739Z,"@odrisck You said you like to keep images to a minimum, does using styling to create psuedo-images (like the robot excercise) cut down on load times? For example, if you created the robot as an image and just added the animation for the eyes over it, would that have a noticable load time effect?"
devstan,2015-01-01T19:01:58.725Z,I don't think It would. But let the master answer.
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T19:03:48.912Z,"Also, another quick question about web design to anyone. I've never considered the DOM as a tree until going through the Code School tutorials. When the 'pros' are designing and coding web pages is it a typical excercise to write out the DOM as a tree?"
devstan,2015-01-01T19:04:36.072Z,They probably already got it in their head.
deamme,2015-01-01T19:04:48.812Z,My robot antenna got messed up but I finished the lesson? http://i.imgur.com/6xETy9z.png
devstan,2015-01-01T19:05:00.799Z,Oh lol
devstan,2015-01-01T19:05:03.268Z,but gj!
deamme,2015-01-01T19:05:08.812Z,Thanks aha
odrisck,2015-01-01T19:05:41.373Z,"I’m hardly the Master. What I have is a respect for using code to create visuals. images will always have a place, but I like that you can be so flexible with just code, it makes me have a happy :)"
odrisck,2015-01-01T19:06:13.733Z,"I think you can load your page down with way to much code as easily as you can with images, but at its core, the computer sees it all as code"
odrisck,2015-01-01T19:07:24.625Z,"for example, I rather style text in css than the way we use to do it, create an image file with text in an image program then load it into a table in a web page, thats just pure bloat"
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T19:08:48.464Z,"Makes sense. Plus, easier to change when the customer decides to change from Franks Deli to Frank's Deli. "
odrisck,2015-01-01T19:09:31.785Z,"yes. Also, I try to keep this in mind, as I learn. I need to always know WHY I’m choosing to do something a certain way. If I decide I need to do this in JS, I need to know why, is it better in some way or am I being lazy :)"
devstan,2015-01-01T19:10:11.624Z,"Hmm, great mindset"
odrisck,2015-01-01T19:10:15.757Z,"just an example, so sometimes I’ll choose to do something in css and sometimes I’ll add an image or whatever, but, I have to be able to articulate to myself, why, and be satisfied that its the best choice"
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T19:11:04.340Z,The duck on the desk.
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T19:11:47.763Z,When writing code I've always explained it to the rubber duck on my desk. Talking out code makes me find bugs before I write it.
odrisck,2015-01-01T19:12:08.605Z,oh yeah I find that simply the act of articulating what issue I’m having will produce an answer
odrisck,2015-01-01T19:12:19.157Z,thats why I really love that we have this community available
odrisck,2015-01-01T19:12:28.197Z,not everyone is ok with talking to a rubber duck :P

iyeager2004,2015-01-01T19:54:31.993Z,"In the 'Working with the DOM' tutorials it teaches addClass and removeClass, and than shows remove all .highlight classes before adding it. You can cut all that down to one line of code using the toggleClass. Funny that they left that out."
iyeager2004,2015-01-01T19:55:47.923Z,"The great thing is though, that as I'm doing the examples I have my own web-page open on another laptop and I'm refactoring it to use jQuery everywhere instead of all my DOM Javascript. So much cleaner."

funkysi,2015-01-01T20:45:54.514Z,I use wordpress for my blog
Nocando,2015-01-01T20:46:51.476Z,"For the websites that I'm building from the tutorials. Should I put the websites on my portfolio, like the one from General Assembly?"

davisec52,2015-01-01T20:51:01.029Z,@FlashB I would suggest a self-hosted WordPress blog.
FlashB,2015-01-01T20:57:55.113Z,WordPress it is. Now to find a decent host!
odran037,2015-01-01T21:00:09.085Z,I host my site on Fused.com. I think they are great. I started my hosting with them after getting a $200 credit for hosting just for showing them I completed HTML/CSS and PHP on Codecademy.

Kadams223,2015-01-01T21:33:14.521Z,I still can't the robot's flashing eye toggle button to work:

  });

</body>"
Kadams223,2015-01-01T21:35:08.058Z,"I've also noticed there slides sometimes use single quotes and other time use double quotes.  And we defined the button to use class flash but flash was never created, unless I missed something"
kengdahl,2015-01-01T21:35:57.112Z,Hello World! Employi @ Arduino in Sweden signing in. Want to learn how to code. Only have a little experience with programming in C.
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:36:07.727Z,"ok so here is the advice I give on that issue, because it worked for me, I moved my code over to codepen, put it in the proper lil boxes, and it all works"
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:36:25.084Z,"thats how I realized my code worked, so if refreshing the page doesn’t fix the issue, try porting it over to codepen "
StevenKW,2015-01-01T21:36:36.440Z,Dang robot!
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:36:50.659Z,"so you know if you have your code right, other than that I’ll post the link to my codepen robot so you can check your cocde, it looks right to me, but I could be missing something"
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:36:56.990Z,http://codepen.io/kodriscoll/pen/RNRpXZ
Kadams223,2015-01-01T21:38:59.113Z,I tried it in code pen but it didnt work there either.  thank you @odrisck. Did you get it to work on dash as well?
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:39:09.579Z,nope it never worked on dash
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:39:18.814Z,"go compare your code to mine, see if you can find the problem"
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:39:39.750Z,"my laser eyes kept flashing into one, so I’d have two red and one big cyclops white eye"
cshutchinson,2015-01-01T21:42:43.223Z,it was posted here yesterday that the problem could be fixed by:
cshutchinson,2015-01-01T21:42:59.234Z,paul davidson
cshutchinson,2015-01-01T21:43:01.848Z,The Dash CSS Robot challenge was a lot of fun! Noticed that I had to include the background-size again (75px 150px) in the animation keyframes selector as well...else would get a single red blinking light instead of matching against the 2 white lights. Pretty nifty CSS animation features!
cshutchinson,2015-01-01T21:43:26.836Z,"i don't know if this will help, I haven't tried it, but maybe it will of some assistance"
Kadams223,2015-01-01T21:43:59.655Z,@odrisck Im wondering why no one else is complaining about.  The only thing I see different is u use a different jquery link
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:44:23.442Z,lots of folks have had problems with the robot :)
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:44:50.219Z,I notice that each counselor has a different solution response too LOL
cshutchinson,2015-01-01T21:46:25.474Z,"@odrisck is there  a way we can compare our code to yours, or did you email it or something?"
Kadams223,2015-01-01T21:47:22.165Z,"no one is responding on the facebook Q&A.  Frustrating, I hate to move onto another step without getting this to work.  I changed the jquery link and that didn't work.  I'll keep looking."
RobertCristian,2015-01-01T21:47:33.772Z,"I have a newbie question for ""more experienced"" but i'm curious: if i want to go on the back-end dev journey and learn those languages(php&co), should i dabble in front-end ? Thank you!"

odrisck,2015-01-01T21:50:45.157Z,refresh your page @ObviousQuark sometimes Dash needs a kick in the rump :)
ObviousQuark,2015-01-01T21:51:17.277Z,Darn. Didnt work.
ObviousQuark,2015-01-01T21:51:27.383Z,Thanks for the tip though...
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:51:35.912Z,"then its time to debug, something is likely done incorrectly"
odrisck,2015-01-01T21:52:01.441Z,no problem :)

I'm a recent mechanical engineering grad but I've been increasingly working towards a career in web development. I completed a web dev bootcamp this past Summer and have been building some skills on my own in my free time since then but it's a challenge. Looking forward to working with some people, great idea!

RobertCristian,2015-01-01T21:54:43.680Z,"Me, from reddit"
JohnQQ,2015-01-01T21:56:40.518Z,"@Kadams223  do you have Jquery plugged in correctly? If I'm not mistaken, you can check it by typing ->  alert(jQuery); inside <script> tag."
dflan,2015-01-01T21:57:36.980Z,It was r/webdev thread on reddit
funkysi,2015-01-01T21:59:25.939Z,"I heard about you on twitter, someone I follow was excited to give you a try"
Kadams223,2015-01-01T22:01:11.091Z,@odrisck @JohnQQ I got it to work it was a issue with the double quotes vs single quotes (their slides show the quotes both ways more than once!
Kadams223,2015-01-01T22:01:23.271Z,however it still only works in codepen
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:01:30.526Z,"I’m so glad you figured it out, those quotes will get you everytime :)"
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:01:36.030Z,yes mine never worked in dash
ObviousQuark,2015-01-01T22:01:41.576Z,I'm positive I wrote it correctly
ObviousQuark,2015-01-01T22:01:50.840Z,It works and everything
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:02:08.729Z,which checkpoint @ObviousQuark 
cshutchinson,2015-01-01T22:02:14.977Z,congrats Kellie nothing like the feeling of fixing something broken!
Harames,2015-01-01T22:02:50.982Z,Hey for everyone that is on or has done the Stanford course. What speed do you watch the videos. I personally watch them at 1.5x the speed because they get slightly boring.  
ObviousQuark,2015-01-01T22:02:57.931Z,"#6 ""Create a small style in the main stylesheet, and give it an opacity of 0"""
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:03:10.233Z,can you post your code
ObviousQuark,2015-01-01T22:03:29.956Z,"Er, the whole thing, or the bit that changes opacity"
trisell,2015-01-01T22:03:43.909Z,@PKMNinja  I watch them at about 2.5 or 3x
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:04:10.709Z,the bit they are asking for
Harames,2015-01-01T22:04:12.309Z,You can watch them at 3x?
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:04:14.119Z,just for the checkpoint
ObviousQuark,2015-01-01T22:04:17.439Z,"small {

"
Harames,2015-01-01T22:04:26.288Z,I only get the option to 2x
trisell,2015-01-01T22:05:26.033Z,I do a lot of online video learning. So I bought a program called enounce. It allows up to 4x on flash videos
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:05:30.012Z,the small business websites checkpoint 6 is not that
trisell,2015-01-01T22:05:41.585Z,http://www.enounce.com/myspeed
Harames,2015-01-01T22:05:43.585Z,OK
StevenKW,2015-01-01T22:05:57.162Z,@PKMNinja I speed them up. 
ObviousQuark,2015-01-01T22:06:41.992Z,"Well, its telling me to do that, and it says its checkpoint #6"
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:06:56.871Z,for esha’s restaurant?
ObviousQuark,2015-01-01T22:07:05.192Z,Yes.
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:07:09.448Z,ok looking
trisell,2015-01-01T22:07:25.631Z,"I had to work up to where I am at. I started at 1.5, when to 2, then 2.5, then 3...Also depends on the speaker...some speakers are especially trying, so I push them to 3.5 or 4..."
trisell,2015-01-01T22:07:55.515Z,But it's nice watching 40 hours of video in 10 - 20 hours time. Gives me 20 hours I otherwise wouldn't have.
Harames,2015-01-01T22:08:09.545Z,"Yeah, I bet that is very nice"

cshutchinson,2015-01-01T22:18:40.315Z,@ObviousQuark this is what I have for that step....

odrisck,2015-01-01T22:21:37.296Z,didnt use one :)
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:22:04.568Z,"I brewed my coffee in a french press, poured enough for two mugs into the blender with about a tbs of butter and a tbs of coconut oil and blended well till all frothy"
StevenKW,2015-01-01T22:22:56.796Z,Well that's kind of a recipe :) I thought it was more involved. So it's butter and coconut oil?
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:23:09.686Z,"yes, grass fed butter and virgin coconut oil"
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:23:14.173Z,the good stuff

StevenKW,2015-01-01T22:23:58.760Z,heh well I don't have that stuff so I'll use peanut butter and olive oil just to try it out...
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:24:09.576Z,I try to only eat things that can be produced naturally :)

odrisck,2015-01-01T22:38:07.077Z,"welcome to FCC @Chasecode, We take you from front end, some html/css, through JS and jQuery and into the backend with node.js and Mongodb"
Kadams223,2015-01-01T22:38:16.245Z,@odrisck Soooo when I did this which changed the order to put the jquery string after the stylesheet link it works in dash.  weird:
Kadams223,2015-01-01T22:38:21.709Z,"<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poller+One' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
<script src=""//assets/jquery.js""></script>"
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:38:26.604Z,awesome
Kadams223,2015-01-01T22:38:46.187Z,can u see if that works in ur dash too?
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:38:54.728Z,"I’ll keep that in mind the next time someone has issues with the robot :) thank you for sharing what worked for you, I hope you are here the next time someone has an issue :)"
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:39:04.046Z,I’ll take a look

odrisck,2015-01-01T22:41:30.749Z,"heh, dash has removed my buttons, I’m glad I moved it over to codepen :)"
terakilobyte,2015-01-01T22:42:05.011Z,"sorry, protocol relative.."
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:42:13.664Z,"oh there they are, I was at the wrong point in the lesson LOL"
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:42:33.556Z,I already have my jquery after my fonts
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:45:37.168Z,OOO but I did figure out why it wasn’t working. my jquery link only had one / rather than two I had <script src=“/assets/jquery.js”></script>  it needed to be <script src=“//assets/jquery.js”></script>  In codepen I have a different link to jQ
Kadams223,2015-01-01T22:47:23.364Z,I'm guessing one of their slides was wrong...
Kadams223,2015-01-01T22:48:25.657Z,I think I probably had one / before as well
odrisck,2015-01-01T22:48:55.614Z,"likely, but now we’ve caught it, and when it happens to the next person we can answer better :)"
cshutchinson,2015-01-01T23:04:26.495Z,try.jQuery.com taught me so much. I have pages and pages of notes that will surely be handy one day.
Harames,2015-01-01T23:05:13.932Z,yeah onto challenge 20

Nocando,2015-01-01T23:49:24.306Z,I am doing step 3. Now I'm on the part where I'm building my own portfolio after help building a website for Anna. I'm not sure what I should put on my own website.

sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:50:15.420Z,@odrisck any thoughts on my situation?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:50:26.629Z,my sole purpose coming here today was to figure this out haha
StevenKW,2015-01-01T23:51:16.274Z,"`ahhh... the 'ol, ""Why are we using javascript"" discussion going on again` Where is this discussion?"
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:51:18.192Z,"honestly I don’t have much experience with two monitors, the bf thinks I need to use the big monitor with my laptop, and I can see the benefit of two, but really when I was working on that ginormous monitor I didn’t feel like I needed anymore space"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:51:42.557Z,ya. i used two when i was working but one was just a web browser
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:52:03.873Z,"and now that I have a hotkey for a fullscreen terminal, idk if i'd need that"
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:52:05.095Z,"I think if he set me up with two I would likely prefer it, but I just don’t really see it right now"
StevenKW,2015-01-01T23:52:11.146Z,Get an utlrawide http://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-34UM95 close the mbp
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:52:38.430Z,@StevenKW I saw an ultra wide on black friday. they are hideous
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:52:47.362Z,"the current plan is to get my linux box up for dev at my desk, with the big monitor, and my laptop remains my casual/gaming system"

sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:52:58.528Z,^

odrisck,2015-01-01T23:53:32.815Z,but I can get a kickass linux system going for $300
StevenKW,2015-01-01T23:53:46.317Z,how are they hideous? I haven't seen one in person. The specs seem pretty good.
shortsynapse,2015-01-01T23:53:49.883Z,I suggest you do!
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:54:01.127Z,I was thinking of maybe doing this: ![stand](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BdDRxvRDL._SY355_.jpg)
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:54:07.660Z,isn’t she pretty
StevenKW,2015-01-01T23:54:14.734Z,That's cool.
shortsynapse,2015-01-01T23:54:31.307Z,I don't know how you guys work with only one screen though xD
officialswanson,2015-01-01T23:54:43.807Z,"finally cleared the ticket queue at work, time to start back to the FCC challenges. :)"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:54:44.455Z,"ya, and then just connect the thunderbolt to my iMac and use my mbp"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:54:55.810Z,@shortsynapse multiple desktops on mac
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:55:00.370Z,"a lot of people prefer two, its just not something I’ve found a need for, now if I was a designer? yeah that I can see, or a games dev? even then I can see it"
StevenKW,2015-01-01T23:55:03.195Z,I like the idea of one really wide monitor.
shortsynapse,2015-01-01T23:55:09.735Z,good point @sircharleswatson 
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:55:21.126Z,it's easier to swipe back and forth on the trackpad then move the mouse cursor all the way to a second monitor
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:55:29.966Z,^
officialswanson,2015-01-01T23:55:41.021Z,3 finger swipe for workspaces is my jam
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:55:50.990Z,"which, being on a 13"" monitor, i usually have 5 or 6 desktops open at a time"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:56:00.825Z,@officialswanson exactly
shortsynapse,2015-01-01T23:56:05.809Z,I have 2 windows of sublime text on my main monitor and chrome/browsers on the other (instant refreshing)
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:56:12.497Z,I confused the bejebus out of myself with multiple desktops LOL
officialswanson,2015-01-01T23:56:18.036Z,"generally, i'm on linux, so i set shortcuts for workspace right/left"
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:56:23.074Z,"I’ll give it a go again, I just need to set it up better"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:56:30.948Z,"@odrisck they re-order automatically, but you can turn that feature off"
StevenKW,2015-01-01T23:56:35.541Z,WindowsKey+ArrowKeys is super convenient.
officialswanson,2015-01-01T23:56:46.438Z,oooooooh i hate the auto-reordering
officialswanson,2015-01-01T23:56:47.826Z,lol
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:56:48.456Z,@odrisck the re-ordering is probably what confused you
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:57:00.129Z,"once i turned that off, it was 100 times better"
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:57:09.649Z,"oh thanks, I’ll do that and see if its better :)"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:57:15.814Z,and then you can assign apps to certain desktops and they are always there
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:57:23.080Z,nice
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:57:51.948Z,"yep thats precisely what confused me, if its all organized I can do it, but if I have to hunt I figure it may as well all be in a big pile in front of me"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:57:52.453Z,"ok, I think this talk is helping me decide that i can deal with one monitor and just put my laptop to the side when i'm using the big screen"
odrisck,2015-01-01T23:57:54.740Z,easier to hunt it down
shortsynapse,2015-01-01T23:58:13.184Z,"@sircharleswatson I didn't know that, that makes things so much easier! Thank you :)"
StevenKW,2015-01-01T23:58:21.599Z,"`ok, I think this talk is helping me decide that i can deal with one monitor and just put my laptop to the side when i'm using the big screen` YES"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-01T23:58:23.119Z,@shortsynapse no problem :D

Nocando,2015-01-02T01:51:39.268Z,"I also am doing a Front-End Web Developer track at TeamTreehouse, this is going straight into jQuery. Why is it like that? Treehouse tells me to learn the foundation of Javascript."
sauntimo,2015-01-02T01:53:38.740Z,@QuincyLarson I don't know if this is the right forum for this kinda chat but I'd be really interested to hear more about what your thoughts / plans are for scaling. I can image there will be a lot of interest and it might change the dynamics of eg this chat but also group projects if MAUs increase exponentially. I like the focus on real projects - an oft repeated criticism of stuff like codecademy (which I love) is that it's too theoretical and covers syntax but not nitty gritty practicalities.
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T01:53:45.871Z,"@QuincyLarson and the rest of the gang at FCC, not sure if you hear this enough, but thanks for putting this together. I've always been able to find the free tutorials and tracks, but it's the concrete work examples that leave me struggling to put the pieces together or make an impact in the workplace. You guys have bridged that gap between learning on your own, and successfully utilizing free resources towards putting yourself on a tech-career path."
yaskyj,2015-01-02T01:54:58.552Z,@Nocando Other parts of the challenges go through more js. Such as the codecademy js and coderbyte challenges.
Sonju,2015-01-02T01:55:53.862Z,"I am in the challenge 5 building a small business website. Can I get a hint at what I need code i need to write for this challenge: ""Wrap the rest of each menu description inside small tags"".

iyeager2004,2015-01-02T01:56:06.580Z,<small></small>
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T01:56:12.739Z,It's a formatting tag.
odrisck,2015-01-02T01:56:39.483Z,@sauntimo I think jQ is actually a relatively easy intro to understanding JS and what its doing
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T01:56:41.763Z,"So, it'll look something like this <small> menu description here </small>"
odrisck,2015-01-02T01:57:15.495Z,thank you @iyeager2004 I feel the same way about FCC  :)
Nocando,2015-01-02T01:57:36.987Z,  @yaskyj  Thank you for your response
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T01:58:14.465Z,I kind of felt like JQ was learning cheater JS. So many handy functions that obfuscate that pesky parts of navigating the DOM in JS.
odrisck,2015-01-02T01:58:25.252Z,I mean @Nocando :)
odrisck,2015-01-02T01:58:36.565Z,heh the chat gets away from me at times
Nocando,2015-01-02T01:59:05.617Z,"@odrisck haha xD, it's okay! Thank you for the response also. I'm beginning to like this community."
odrisck,2015-01-02T01:59:48.042Z,"I’m so glad, I really feel that the community we have going here is the most valuable resource for learning "
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:00:54.382Z,"@iyeager2004  here is what I coded. Didn't work: 
<small>
<div class=""first"">
<p>Welsh onion soko $14 <br /> Mustard sierra leone bologi kale chard beet greens black-eyed pea sorrel amaranth garlic tigernut spring onion summer purslane asparagus lentil. </p>
</div>
</small>"
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T02:03:08.939Z,"@Sonju Just wrap the text in the <small> tags. <small> is a formatting shortcut for text, like using <h1>. "
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:06:27.122Z,I am I replacing <p> with <small>
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:07:28.702Z,nope. Ok. I'll keep at it. even googled to fry to find answer. I'll read my CSS book
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T02:07:59.993Z,Don't replace. Just put it inside. The <p> puts the text into a paragraph the <small> makes the text look small. 
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:08:17.200Z,put it inside the div
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T02:08:19.059Z,"<div class=""first"">

<p><small>Welsh onion soko $14 <br /> Mustard sierra leone bologi kale chard beet greens black-eyed pea sorrel amaranth garlic tigernut spring onion summer purslane asparagus lentil. </small></p>
</div>"
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:08:20.748Z,not outside it
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:08:25.142Z,yes like that ^
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:11:16.322Z,"<div class=""first”> this is for styling in your css, <small> is html text styling so should be right around the text you wish to make smaller"
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:11:48.904Z,OMG.. thanks! what does the <small></small> element function as? 
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T02:13:23.863Z,"<small> is a css tag. Later you'll learn that you can make the text wrapped in <small> tags be whatever you want, In fact, you can change it based on the browser size, so you can have small be one thing on a computer screen and something completely different on a phone's screen."
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:15:33.111Z,Cool @iyeager2004 . Thanks a lot for taking time to explain it. Thanks 2 @odrisck you rock 2.
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:15:56.312Z,https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small here is an explanation of <small>
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:15:59.423Z,you bet
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:16:12.027Z,thumbs up!
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:28:58.672Z,"Please explain:  ""Comment out"" the paragraph style in your CSS "
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:29:24.373Z,to comment something out you put // or /* in front of it
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:29:34.704Z,use the style they have for their notes already present
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:29:42.447Z,it means the browser will not read it
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:30:36.433Z,I believe its going to be //
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:32:19.323Z,"Example: 
/* first menu*/
<p><small>Welsh onion soko $14 <br /> Mustard sierra leone bologi kale chard beet greens black-eyed pea sorrel amaranth garlic tigernut spring onion summer purslane asparagus lentil.</small></p>"
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:32:46.570Z,you want two //
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:32:53.768Z,/* blah blah*/
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:33:01.728Z,// blah blah//
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:33:03.990Z,// then here is the code
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:33:11.757Z,"in your css, the above isn’t css its html"
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:34:59.867Z,"Do I comment before <p> or before <div class="""">"
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:35:19.529Z,"you don’t comment there, you comment out the p styling in your css between the <style> </style> "
DavidII,2015-01-02T02:36:00.539Z,does break need to be self close 
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:36:05.672Z,you have presumably written some css for paragraphs in your css which lives between the style tags in your html document if you aren’t using a style sheet
DavidII,2015-01-02T02:36:16.500Z,<br/>
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:36:22.342Z,"I’ve never done, but its become preferable to do <br />"
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:36:42.710Z,<br /> worked for me
DavidII,2015-01-02T02:37:24.317Z,"got it thanks, this is first the time I've seen it this way. @Sonju lol I learn some thing new with HTML today. =)"
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:38:50.102Z,@DavidII Never ending... :)
DavidII,2015-01-02T02:38:59.671Z,true story 
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:39:22.690Z,"Oo  chicago, my daughter is in northern maine, are you all going to be in another snowmaggedon this year?"
Sonju,2015-01-02T02:39:45.232Z,"delightfully painful. @odrisck Yes, I moved my comments to style { and it worked. Thanks"
trisell,2015-01-02T02:39:53.975Z,"Wouldn't $(""button"").click(function(){});    be the same as $(""button"").on('click', function(){});?"
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:40:32.589Z,I’m less knowledgeable about jQuery :) but yes it appears to be
trisell,2015-01-02T02:40:44.380Z,"code $(""button"").click();"
trisell,2015-01-02T02:40:46.644Z,smm

trisell,2015-01-02T02:40:54.018Z,that didn't work as planned.
odrisck,2015-01-02T02:41:08.300Z,"however, you will find that if you don’t write it how they tell you to, it wont pass"

odrisck,2015-01-02T02:41:41.512Z,but it hates me so I don’t even try :)

valeness,2015-01-02T05:04:18.739Z,^
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:04:29.446Z,"fortunately for you, we have a process by which we will introduce campers to the non profits :)"
valeness,2015-01-02T05:04:49.468Z,Is finding the bug part of the process? :D
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:05:38.085Z,"pointing out bugs is always good :), but I voted for checking up on your badges and such at the sites we sent you to complete lessons on :)"
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:05:38.267Z,"Guys, I need critique on my portfolio website. I'm trying to get an internship as a front-end developer so I need to make an impression. https://nameless-garden-5870.herokuapp.com/"
valeness,2015-01-02T05:06:31.748Z,"Ah, I see. "
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:06:37.527Z,looking good @bboyjacks 
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:06:47.955Z,"Tell me what you guys think. Right now its filled with filler text and I've only finished one page. I will finish the rest of the page soon, but I want to get some feedback as I go."
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:06:54.730Z,I like the color scheme
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T05:06:59.822Z,"@bboyjacks Quickly, cuz I won't have time to get to it in depth, your site is not responsive. That's a big thing these days."
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:07:10.715Z,^
teddy-error,2015-01-02T05:07:17.378Z,Your quote is hard to read so i won't read it
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:07:33.074Z,"I see, I'm still trying to figure out how to make it responsive"
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:07:47.454Z,"yes, I'll fix that quote"
Nocando,2015-01-02T05:07:53.914Z,If i'm not a web designer. Is it fine to use PSD Mockups for my portfolio?
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:08:08.155Z,https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:08:30.379Z,if you have permission to do so I don’t see why not
valeness,2015-01-02T05:08:32.602Z,"There is no padding for the text on the blog, which looks bad imo. And the links are the standard blue, which clashes."
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:08:39.755Z,thanks @odrisck 
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:08:55.393Z,blogs and resume are not done yet
Nocando,2015-01-02T05:08:59.194Z,I just feel like it's cheating for not having the skills of a Web Designer. That's why i asked :|
valeness,2015-01-02T05:09:02.065Z,"Love the main page though, especially the way you did your picture"
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:09:10.069Z,"but yes, I'll figure those out soon"
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:09:15.426Z,"I do as well, but I agree your quote is eye bleedy"
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:09:15.918Z,thanks @valeness 
StevenKW,2015-01-02T05:09:33.178Z,My eyes did bleed for a second.
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:09:40.662Z,awesome feedback you guys
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:09:50.434Z,maybe try a soft light grey for the quote text
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:09:52.155Z,thanks
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:10:07.795Z,white is too harsh but a rather light gray would be nice
odrisck,2015-01-02T05:10:24.246Z,"I try not to use white if I can keep from it, white and black :)"
bboyjacks,2015-01-02T05:10:47.200Z,awesome thanks @odrisck 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T05:37:16.396Z,Good Morning FCC!
luijoy,2015-01-02T05:45:40.239Z,Good morning @AmmarAliShah 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T05:56:01.867Z,@lui8906 how far are you?
teddy-error,2015-01-02T06:02:15.199Z,"well from edmonton to pakistan it's about 10,673 km"
RussEby,2015-01-02T06:02:46.473Z,"LOL
"
teddy-error,2015-01-02T06:02:55.672Z,or 6631 American kilometres 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T06:03:59.634Z,lol
luijoy,2015-01-02T06:09:25.205Z,@AmmarAliShah I'm focusing more on finishing the complete web dev course now before getting stuck into FCC. I'm on the first Jquery task. ;)
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T06:09:49.450Z,@lui8906 :+1: 
piecedigital,2015-01-02T06:20:45.306Z,@Nocando Often times web designers and developers are not one in the same. There are times where there are just designers and developers separate. However I heard once on a podcast that that is mostly big companies that do it due to their ability to afford having as many employees.
andreeee,2015-01-02T06:23:54.883Z,hello world!

Harames,2015-01-02T06:29:09.409Z,"Yeah, moving onto challenge 20"
Nocando,2015-01-02T06:37:03.415Z,@piecedigital Thank you for your response :D
Harames,2015-01-02T06:38:46.058Z,@teddy-error American kilometers? Do you mean miles? :) :+1:
Nocando,2015-01-02T06:56:33.924Z,"For #5 Challenge. It tells me ""Add the subheading ""A New York City Eatery"" in a second-level header tag, under the h1. I added <h2> tag. It's not giving me a check mark."

teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:02:07.357Z,oh maybe blue isn't a built in color
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:02:18.434Z,"@teddy-error Are you using a pre-styled button (like from Bootstrap?). If so, changing just one property might not work."
teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:03:07.631Z,"Well, with hex codes it works fine. It's weird. Blue just makes it totally black."
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:03:15.541Z,weird
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:04:10.211Z,"@Nocando Dash has a few quirks - like if you add spaces that are valid but NOT what they want you to do, it will deny you your well-deserved check mark. "
teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:04:35.188Z,Maybe Chrome is color blind
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:04:50.457Z,@teddy-error ROFL.

mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:06:12.316Z,@Nocando Try doing a hard refresh. 
Nocando,2015-01-02T07:06:14.989Z,@apexpred Wlecome!
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:06:19.448Z,@apexpred Hello!
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:06:22.559Z,@teddy-error Does it similarly not properly work when using a different browser?
apexpred,2015-01-02T07:06:40.220Z,Ty all
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:06:43.902Z,@Nocando I'm more than happy to pair up with you if you want. Have a few minutes till my break is over
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:06:48.460Z,"Also just joined as well, pleasure to make your acquaintances."
Nocando,2015-01-02T07:07:11.774Z,@mjcCodes How does pairing work?
Nocando,2015-01-02T07:07:29.193Z,pretty new to all of this
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:08:04.573Z,"Well, we use an app to share screens. The standard one around these parts is ScreenHero but I have skype as well. That way I can see your screen and perhaps see something you're not seeing."
teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:08:26.756Z,@benstoltz yeah actually I can replicate blue being black for button elements on safari as well
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:08:31.005Z,Sometimes a second set of eyes is all that is needed
Nocando,2015-01-02T07:09:16.112Z,"that's true. I need to remake a skype account. But, ill do that later. Ill just try to figure something out right now xD. But, thank you very much!"
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:09:18.923Z,@teddy-error Interesting. Is it replicated in Firefox also? Are you using any frameworks?
Nocando,2015-01-02T07:09:25.119Z,Gosh community is so nice lol
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:09:37.455Z,@Nocando Sure! Take a look at screenhero - they have a free 14-day trial. 
Nocando,2015-01-02T07:10:29.229Z,@mjcCodes Thank you 
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:10:50.978Z,"@teddy-error same offer goes for you - if you want a second set of eyes, I have a few mins to pair up and see what's going on with your project"
Nocando,2015-01-02T07:12:49.168Z,Should I use https://www.heroku.com/ to upload my portfolio?
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:13:32.850Z,interesting - never used that site
teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:14:00.905Z,"Thanks Jeanette. It's not super important. I did break it down to the bare essentials with no external scripts and can confirm that, across all browsers, blue means black in the case of button objects."
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:14:36.607Z,But not with other objects?
teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:14:46.992Z,Correct
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:14:58.350Z,@teddy-error That is just weird. But if you're happy... :-) 
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:15:06.074Z,That's just....strange.
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:15:23.509Z,"Alright folks, back I go to CodeAcademy. Back in half hour or so. :-)"
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:15:32.464Z,Enjoy.
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:15:49.211Z,Thanks! I have one more challenge to go till I have 30 completed. SUPER excited!
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:16:37.583Z,Sweet :) I haven't done much on CodeCademy in a long while.
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:16:55.536Z,Almost finished with beginner JS track.
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:17:02.890Z,"OK, off I go. TTYS."
Nocando,2015-01-02T07:17:12.823Z,Byeeeee
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:17:28.337Z,Adieu
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:27:00.223Z,"I'm stuck on 3.16 of ""TryjQuery"" since the last three days"
Harames,2015-01-02T07:27:27.937Z,@AmmarAliShah whats your problem
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:27:34.651Z,just don't understand the video
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:27:54.257Z,It just goes over my head
Harames,2015-01-02T07:28:23.948Z,Then just try the challenges and use the slides. If you need to use the hints
teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:28:55.357Z,Which aspect Ammar ?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:29:34.309Z,"the ""data"" attribute: using it in jQuery"
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:31:30.003Z,"Could you be a bit more specific Ammar, what about it are you having trouble understanding?"
teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:31:32.292Z,http://api.jquery.com/data/
teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:31:50.504Z,Basically it lets you append something to an object like a <p> or a <h1> 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:32:18.271Z,I've watched the video like 3 times
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:32:28.300Z,I guess i'll just watch it later
Harames,2015-01-02T07:33:45.176Z,gtg to be good night everyone
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:36:01.038Z,Good Night @PKMNinja 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-02T07:38:21.204Z,@PKMNinja Good night
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:38:33.140Z,"Ammar, could you post the line of code that you've been trying for that challenge?"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:40:45.123Z,@benstoltz I'm not trying out any line: i said i'm just not nderstanding this video: http://try.jquery.com/levels/3/sections/16
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:40:58.757Z,understanding*
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:41:25.842Z,"Ah, understand now. I thought you were referencing one of the sections there specifically."
apexpred,2015-01-02T07:43:26.285Z,wierd I couldn't use github to log into the forums so I just made an account
benstoltz,2015-01-02T07:43:57.697Z,It was acting wonky for me too. I ended up going into a thread and then it properly came up/allowed me to join.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:45:23.408Z,Nope. I guess i'm just not paying attention. I'll try again later
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:46:33.105Z,"@AmmarAliShah That happened to me too. What I did is I moved to a different challenge, did other things for a few days. Then I went back to it and it made sense. "
mjcCodes,2015-01-02T07:46:40.205Z,Sometimes the brain just needs a break. 
teddy-error,2015-01-02T07:50:03.691Z,"So, javascript is the part of web coding that allows you to make webpages interactive and dynamic. And what that piece of javascript code does is allow you to take some object you have and give it ( or read from it) an internal value. Much to the same effect as $(""name"").text() or $(""name"").text(""Ammar""), but internally"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T07:50:08.987Z,@mjcCodes I've decided that too. I'm going on a jQuery break and i'll just mess around with html/css for a few days

mjcCodes,2015-01-02T08:48:13.696Z,@teddy-error YAY glad you figured it out.

SparkyAMG,2015-01-02T10:00:08.620Z,Just dropped in for the first time in a while - is it me or have the FreeCodeCamp Challenges completely changed?
deamme,2015-01-02T10:01:40.274Z,I can't sign in with github anymore?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T10:03:50.045Z,@SparkyAMG they have changed
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T10:04:05.732Z,@deamme i have problems with twitter

Maximization,2015-01-02T10:04:35.173Z,Hello campers! Happy New Year
SparkyAMG,2015-01-02T10:05:19.665Z,@AmmarAliShah thanks - not complaining as I've gone off on a tangent and have been learning AngularJS and the MEAN Stack separately anyway
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T10:06:05.328Z,@SparkyAMG from where?
SparkyAMG,2015-01-02T10:09:12.238Z,thinkster.io
SparkyAMG,2015-01-02T10:10:32.013Z,"and I've also purchased 2 books -  'AngularJS: Up and Running' and 'Node.js, MongoDB and AngularJS Web Development'"
teddy-error,2015-01-02T10:12:59.107Z,"I heard someone say Github was being weird, but on the forums... I personally had no issues linking"

teddy-error,2015-01-02T10:14:12.832Z,That looks v delicious @AmmarAliShah

devstan,2015-01-02T10:29:47.066Z,"I see that most of the challenges are about js and jquery right?
"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-02T10:30:20.301Z,@teddy-error it is too :smile: 
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T10:30:20.317Z,@devstan most of which challenges?
devstan,2015-01-02T10:30:30.743Z,FCC
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T10:32:26.458Z,@devstan The focus of FCC is on fullstack development using JavaScript
devstan,2015-01-02T10:32:37.644Z,Oh k
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T10:34:45.384Z,in reference to the question about Github. We’re currenty experiencing an issue with github signups/signins where a small % of users are incorrectly being authorized as another user on the site and current traces point towards accounts made with github
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T10:35:47.332Z,"apologies for any inconvenience, but protecting privacy is a top concern"

lamprosmousselimis,2015-01-02T12:20:25.884Z,Hi @Lumiras 
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:37:01.932Z,hello ppl
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:37:30.770Z,how do i insert a background image........
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:38:50.698Z,Is this wright??????????????
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:38:55.187Z,"body {
 text-align: center;
 background: url(""C:\Software\'kid'\img\hello.png"");
}"
Nocando,2015-01-02T12:40:17.913Z,hmmmm
Nocando,2015-01-02T12:40:47.418Z,"try this background: url(""..\Software\'kid'\img\hello.png"");"
Lumiras,2015-01-02T12:41:08.505Z,"@TheGermanGuy you don't need to use the entire path...as long as you have everything in one directory you should only need to specify background:url(""img/hello.png"");"
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:41:39.315Z,ok......................
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:41:59.943Z,my html file is in dekstop
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:42:08.031Z,*desktop
Lumiras,2015-01-02T12:43:26.844Z,"that's OK, just put everything in one folder with a subfolder named img"
Lumiras,2015-01-02T12:44:14.118Z,then have your index.html and main css file in the main folder
Maximization,2015-01-02T12:45:16.632Z,^
Lumiras,2015-01-02T12:45:20.898Z,"then, you can refer to files with their relative path instead of their absolute path"
Lumiras,2015-01-02T12:45:50.935Z,"if you tried to deploy something referring to C:/ on the web, it wouldn't work because the web server isn't going to be pulling the image from your local system"
Lumiras,2015-01-02T12:48:32.073Z,I hope that made enough sense...paths are confusing
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:48:43.525Z,"now.......my html file ""one.html"" is in  a folder named 'kid'.......inside 'kid' i have a subfolder named 'img' which contains the image 'hello.png'"
Maximization,2015-01-02T12:49:03.008Z,perfect
towwiow,2015-01-02T12:49:41.048Z,good morning everyone!

TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:50:22.064Z,i am trying to insert a background image using <style>
Maximization,2015-01-02T12:50:35.173Z,@towwiow sure
Maximization,2015-01-02T12:50:45.875Z,@TheGermanGuy that's ok too
towwiow,2015-01-02T12:51:03.747Z,@TheGermanGuy - https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Help ; you can ask your questions here for help :)
Lumiras,2015-01-02T12:51:51.101Z,"@TheGermanGuy yeah, so you just need to use ""img/hello.png"" inside the style tag"
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:52:40.819Z,one sec ppl.........
TheGermanGuy,2015-01-02T12:53:37.261Z,i think i should jump in to the link given............... @towwiow 
Nocando,2015-01-02T13:01:56.282Z,"@TheGermanGuy to make it easier, put your html file in your folder for example. html/index.html then in the style you can write background: url(""img/filename.png"") Hope this helps"
Zarkopafilis,2015-01-02T13:17:01.810Z,you need /folder/folder/file.extension
devstan,2015-01-02T14:04:53.095Z,Hello guys
Lumiras,2015-01-02T14:05:46.205Z,Hello @devstan!
cshutchinson,2015-01-02T14:12:33.319Z,I am looking to acquire a person domain for bio / resume / etc; can anyone recommend a name generator they are partial to?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:18:04.342Z,I get to set up my whole dev environment again today! Woot!
cshutchinson,2015-01-02T14:18:47.790Z,did you get a new mac yesterday @sircharleswatson ?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:19:21.477Z,We got a new one a couple weeks ago and I was going to just connect my MBP via thunderbolt but the iMac is too old
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:20:01.789Z,"So, I will be setting it up and syncing via dropbox"
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T14:20:19.462Z,@sircharleswatson those kind of chores can be fun in a way though
cshutchinson,2015-01-02T14:20:30.062Z,fresh clean fast fun!
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:20:38.026Z,@terakilobyte I agree :)
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T14:21:03.527Z,I’m guessing you’ll be installing meteor ;)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:21:19.016Z,of course :)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:21:37.527Z,I need it for work ;)
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T14:21:55.132Z,ah more news? full-time?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:22:30.691Z,still not full-time. Gunna pass on the non-paying client to someone else and focus on the paying-client because his project is much more interesting to me
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:23:05.369Z,and the client will be making a final decision about the investment by next week
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:23:45.950Z,"So, hopefully full-time soon"
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T14:23:59.791Z,hoping for/with you
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:24:13.831Z,"hopefully ""employee"" status soon so I don't have to deal with self-employment stuff lol"
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T14:24:16.199Z,who’d you convince to take the other project?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:24:39.716Z,@phlacin Mentioned he was interested
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T14:24:47.670Z,good good
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T14:25:24.105Z,I know things are busy but in a few weeks or so we should look at one of the non profits perhaps
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:25:30.030Z,"ya, So I need to talk to him today and see if he for sure wants to do it and then talk to the client and break the news to him lol"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:26:57.687Z,"@terakilobyte I haven't done any of the MEAN stuff on fcc yet :/ but starting next week, my schedule will be more regular. About 25hrs/week on the paying project, so the rest of the time I can fill it in with FCC"
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T14:27:14.347Z,"well, with no commitment of money there’s really no contract. Food on the table helps increase generosity "
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:27:31.748Z,haha
terakilobyte,2015-01-02T14:27:37.500Z,@sircharleswatson no reason we *have* to do it with mean

sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:30:04.400Z,"@phlacin well, you'll get lots of experience with this project. So you could hold off on the personal projects for a bit :) or use those as a break from the bigger project"

"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:40:36.044Z,@phlacin I was in a band that practiced in mukilteo/lynwood area. I had to commute there every friday afternoon from Bonney Lake. if I left 5 minutes too late i would get stuck in all the traffic heading north on I-5 towards seattle. It was terrible. Took me 3 hours one time to go like 10 miles lol

sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:42:52.058Z,but that time I literally left a few minutes late and got stuck in it. I usually was able to make it in a normal amount of time

JimBry,2015-01-02T14:47:36.773Z,@sircharleswatson Have you thought about doing remote work out here I'm sure there is a demand for some iOS dev's in Seattle
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:48:22.047Z,"@JimBry I'm doing remote work now for a client in California. So I *could* move anywhere. Only problem is, my wife has deep deep deeeeep roots here in Minneapolis."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T14:48:44.899Z,but she is slowly starting to open up to the idea of moving.

seahik,2015-01-02T16:19:05.866Z,Heys...I'm playing around with codepen...got to thinking 
seahik,2015-01-02T16:19:40.684Z,"I wonder if freecodecamp has considered adding a challenge to to make a little project on codepen and share it for review from other campers.   Add the challenge around 30 when you've finished Codeacademy and Jquery.  Would be a nice review of everything to implement it.
"
seahik,2015-01-02T16:20:19.382Z,I think would be cool way to force yourself to implement some of the tools in a easy project.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T16:21:14.422Z,@seahik there are lots of things that people can share early on. Like the projects from the Dash courses

seahik,2015-01-02T16:22:14.711Z,@sircharleswatson I just think it might be neat to have it part of a challenge.

TobogganMD,2015-01-02T16:33:53.395Z,@seahik I think that's a good idea. I've found that it's way harder to get started on your own little project than just following the instructions codecademy/dash/try jquery give you
seahik,2015-01-02T16:42:30.122Z,@TobogganMD Hey ya...yes thats my exact problem.  I'm not sure the best way to go about starting.  I've been looking at some simple programs like timers and calculators on codepen and trying to understand them and make adjustments to them.  The blank screen is a little intimidating.

sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T16:47:17.311Z,the fun part will be figuring out how to sync the two computers so that I can easily switch between them
odrisck,2015-01-02T16:47:49.876Z,heh let me know if you get that part worked out :)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T16:48:40.435Z,@odrisck It most likely will have something to do with dropbox
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T16:48:46.841Z,@sircharleswatson I asked a few days ago if imaging a dev environment is a good idea for FCC stuff. Seems like you just answered my question. :)
benstoltz,2015-01-02T16:49:47.226Z,@sircharleswatson I just keep my code up in github repos and make regular pushes so I can swap between computers if need be. Also Evernote + dropbox ftw.
benstoltz,2015-01-02T16:50:52.194Z,"Question for everybody actually....does anyone have experience mining tweets with Python, either using libraries or just using the twitter api straight with oauth?"
iyeager2004,2015-01-02T16:51:16.690Z,"Playing around on the regex assignment, which I've always thought was so cool. You get 100% workable code that ends up looking like... (\d{4})x(\d{3}\d?)"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T16:51:21.233Z,"@benstoltz Ya, I could do that but some stuff is not on github. It'd be great to be able to just clone a repo on one computer and then my dropbox-synced folders will update it and i'll have it on both :)"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T16:52:37.317Z,then i don't have to worry about if I left my desktop computer and forgot to push my changes to github before I go to the coffee shop and work on my laptop
odrisck,2015-01-02T16:52:47.764Z,good idea
benstoltz,2015-01-02T16:54:38.811Z,Si :)
benstoltz,2015-01-02T16:56:29.122Z,"Anyway, point of the python question above, is I've used Tweepy in the past and had to standardize the times coming in of tweets because otherwise it wonked things up. I'm thinking that's the nature of the tweet object and not a feature of the tweepy library itself, but was wanting to double check with someone else (presuming anyone knows :) )"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T16:57:56.762Z,@benstoltz Can you repeat the question?
benstoltz,2015-01-02T17:02:15.396Z,"@sircharleswatson Sorry, heh, that was a bit disjointed. Okay so I'm working with the Twitter streaming api with Python. You can either use oauth to access the api directly or use a library (like Tweepy) to access it. The api returns a JSON object, however (at least with Tweepy) the time field (when the thing was tweeted) is not the same...obviously because people can be tweeting from different time-zones. So in the past I've had to write something up to clean up this time field, if you will. I'm hoping someone else here is similarly familiar with this to determine whether or not this is an issue with other twitter libraries and/or directly using oauth, or if this is an issue with Tweepy itself?"
benstoltz,2015-01-02T17:03:11.467Z,Actually more that I think about it...it probably doesn't matter and I'll want to clean the time anyway....I think I'm going to be using both the search and streaming api's..../ponder
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T17:05:19.669Z,"@benstoltz Usually on API's like that, they standardize the time. like GMT +- 0"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T17:05:41.903Z,so each time zone would be GMT -6 or whatever
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T17:06:09.853Z,but everything should come in order streaming wise
benstoltz,2015-01-02T17:06:45.262Z,"@sircharleswatson One would think that, but at least using a particular library it isn't...Then again it returns a JSON object that's a little different from the twitter JSON object so who knows what crud they are doing."
benstoltz,2015-01-02T17:07:50.654Z,"That's certainly true, regarding coming in order....however I'm cleaning the data from the api, sticking it in a database, and then running analysis on it. Specifically ones based on space and time, then visualizing it. So accurate time/dates are pretty important for me."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T17:08:08.123Z,@benstoltz What does the time format look like for an object? can you post an example here?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T17:09:12.957Z,"time zones shouldn't matter about ""when"" it happened. it will always be in order"
benstoltz,2015-01-02T17:09:35.340Z,"I'm not just gathering data from the streaming api, but also from the historical search api."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T17:10:48.842Z,can you post an example of some of the dates of objects you're getting?
benstoltz,2015-01-02T17:11:19.925Z,"Oh sure, I'm just trying to not destroy chat with a massive JSON post :P"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T17:13:36.362Z,just pick a couple tweets and take out just the date object from each of them and post only the dates here

sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T18:46:27.368Z,@Lumiras Correct
QuincyLarson,2015-01-02T18:47:08.683Z,@benstoltz That’s a great resource! Definitely belongs on our forum! :)
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:47:41.886Z,"nice, that'll be a welcome addition to the JS bag of tricks"

benstoltz,2015-01-02T18:48:59.115Z,Hrmm.....so apparently Microsoft is transitioning to a new browser.
Harames,2015-01-02T18:50:25.329Z,@benstoltz What?
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:50:28.671Z,"@benstoltz in name only, really"
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:50:39.787Z,it still uses their old busted rendering engine
benstoltz,2015-01-02T18:50:43.711Z,@Lumiras Yeah
benstoltz,2015-01-02T18:51:15.480Z,At least it's not IE 6 - 8 :p
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:51:22.698Z,"I think it's only going to create confusion because they're shipping this new thing (called Spartan) with IE 11 on Windows 10...you know, the newest version of Windows after Windows 8"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T18:52:00.374Z,They should just give up LOL
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:52:07.350Z,sounds good to me :)
benstoltz,2015-01-02T18:52:07.439Z,Of course it's going to cause confusion. When has Microsoft ever made a seemingly 'big' change like this when it hasn't caused confusion?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T18:52:32.871Z,They should just stick to making xbox and related things 
Harames,2015-01-02T18:52:42.998Z,"So two internet browsers on one machine preinstalled. Cool, now I can uninstall two crappy applications. "
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:53:03.452Z,"if you can actually uninstall them, @PKMNinja "
RussEby,2015-01-02T18:53:05.141Z,I actually like IE.
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:53:12.895Z,!!!
benstoltz,2015-01-02T18:53:20.660Z,Actually no. Let's keep Windows around. It distracts the hackers/virus makers from making more crap to target linux/mac.
Harames,2015-01-02T18:53:21.561Z,"@Lumiras Yeah, hopefully "
LMWBXR,2015-01-02T18:53:31.502Z,"Hi, just starting jQuery, are there any good resources out there for someone with no experience starting from scratch?  "
RussEby,2015-01-02T18:53:36.379Z,And I prefer Windows over MAC or Linux.
RussEby,2015-01-02T18:54:20.764Z,Should I leave now?
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:54:26.035Z,"@RussEby Interesting, I know that IE10 is at least making efforts to be standards-compliant, but they're still so far back on so many things"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T18:54:39.834Z,@LMWBXR I'd like to think the FreeCodeCamp course is good to follow for jQuery :)
admhlt,2015-01-02T18:54:53.111Z,"@RussEby I do too, but maybe that's because I haven't had time to give OS X or Linux a fair shake"
Harames,2015-01-02T18:55:07.535Z,@LMWBXR How about http://jquery.com/
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:55:11.539Z,"and the main problem with IE is that when Mozilla and Webkit agree on something, it seems like the IE people go ""well, how about we do it this completely different way?"""
RussEby,2015-01-02T18:55:16.133Z,Microsoft still needs to support the large Enterprise market that can't handle upgrading browsers every six months.
RussEby,2015-01-02T18:56:06.758Z,"Too many Enterprise tools still support IE 8, Our phone recording software we have from Cisco won't run on anything but IE8 and we just bought the thing!"
Lumiras,2015-01-02T18:56:41.696Z,I use software at my dumb office job that still relies on ActiveX :(
Harames,2015-01-02T18:56:42.552Z,I have to go be back in 40 or 50 minutes.
LMWBXR,2015-01-02T18:56:47.532Z,Yes lol. Working on the first lesson in code school and having to google to learn the proper commands
seahik,2015-01-02T18:58:33.234Z,@LMWBXR  folks are happy to help here or in Help chat room...if you are stuck on a question 
RussEby,2015-01-02T18:58:54.967Z,"There's the issue Microsoft still needs to support those companies that won't give up old tech. They can't just remove it. They've tried. With Win 8 they wanted to break from the old system, but too many people complained and they pulled it back in. The idea with two browsers is to have one current and one legacy."
Lumiras,2015-01-02T19:00:00.312Z,"I get that, but to me that feels like they keep fracturing their user base again and again, and eventually it's a big mess and everyone has to support 5 simultaneous versions of software"
Lumiras,2015-01-02T19:00:29.854Z,I have the same apprehensions about Android...just looking at version requirements on apps gives me a headache
RussEby,2015-01-02T19:00:54.734Z,"They also have a user base many times the size of any other platform (I'm talking Desktop, I understand mobile and Server is different)"
jennEDVT,2015-01-02T19:00:57.254Z,Hello world! I'm looking forward to becoming more involved in FreeCodeCamp!
odrisck,2015-01-02T19:01:12.138Z,welcome to our community @jennEDVT 
jennEDVT,2015-01-02T19:01:35.373Z,Thanks @odrisck 
seahik,2015-01-02T19:01:40.201Z,@LMWBXR i also use http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ ....for quick questions...but some say its not doesnt always follow best practices.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T19:01:53.699Z,@seahik It definitely doesnt
benstoltz,2015-01-02T19:01:56.529Z,Welcome @jennEDVT !
Lumiras,2015-01-02T19:02:08.909Z,"@RussEby very true, but I would say that with the world migrating more and more to consumption on mobile devices (via Safari, Chrome and such) that dominance may begin to waver"
seahik,2015-01-02T19:02:09.120Z,@sircharleswatson but for just the basics it has been helpful to me i believe
Maximization,2015-01-02T19:02:57.360Z,w3schools is listed as a no-no resources on r/learnprogramming
Lumiras,2015-01-02T19:03:29.519Z,Mozilla Developer Network is overall a better resource
benstoltz,2015-01-02T19:03:41.526Z,+1 for Moz Dev Network.
RussEby,2015-01-02T19:03:49.319Z,"Yep, even Microsoft understands that. HTML/CSS/JS can be used to write what they call ""modern"" apps, Or what most people call Metro. I think that is very smart of them."
seahik,2015-01-02T19:03:54.965Z,but much more difficult and intimidating for a noob
Lumiras,2015-01-02T19:04:15.189Z,"but w3schools gets a really bad rep, most of the stuff they have on there is fine"
Lumiras,2015-01-02T19:04:43.128Z,I think most people get irritated (rightfully so) that their name falsely indicates that they have something to do with the W3C
RussEby,2015-01-02T19:05:06.556Z,I like the tools over at w3schools. The testing areas and such.
seahik,2015-01-02T19:05:14.841Z,i think maybe ok to use it with a grain of salt?  and plan on switching to moz dev as sooon as feasible?
seahik,2015-01-02T19:05:29.283Z,yes the testing area is great
JimBry,2015-01-02T19:05:43.364Z,S/O to @piecedigital  for the chief keef meme :smile: haha
LMWBXR,2015-01-02T19:06:01.811Z,Thanks.
DavidII,2015-01-02T19:12:25.355Z,@Lumiras  depends on what you are looking for and if you have knowledge.

My creativity is in my head but when I apply it to the web world it doesn't come out straight. but hey! practice. I realize that don't do well with a lot of people and I get more of a satisfaction with the computers. 
zeezey,2015-01-02T19:44:49.601Z,Can you still do webdev if youre not really good at design
Lumiras,2015-01-02T19:46:09.744Z,"@zeezey absolutely! I mean, most backend devs do zero visual design"

StevenKW,2015-01-02T21:04:10.335Z,@admhlt @odrisck Red is great. I watched Season 1 when it was fairly new. It's been so long between the end of Season 1 and now watching Season 2 that I was just happy to be back with the characters. I am enjoying the back stories and I think V is a great addition.
jcjensenjr,2015-01-02T21:04:12.022Z,Looks like a fantastic site
jcjensenjr,2015-01-02T21:04:35.839Z,Just basic html and css
StevenKW,2015-01-02T21:05:05.638Z,I think I will watch the rest before I start working because otherwise I will think about it all day long. :)

Aurite,2015-01-02T21:19:00.460Z,Hi everyone discovering FreecodeCamp great idea ( in France we something similar called Simplon.co ) 
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-02T21:19:35.658Z,welcome @Aurite 
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-02T21:20:31.728Z,@jcjensenjr How have you been learning during those 3 months? I’ve been learning for about the same amount of time
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-02T21:20:44.849Z,but I was glad to find FCC
Aurite,2015-01-02T21:25:38.601Z,nice to meet you @figitalboy 
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-02T21:26:39.871Z,likewise!
piecedigital,2015-01-02T21:27:01.771Z,@Aurite Greetings and welcome to FCC!
apexpred,2015-01-02T21:27:11.967Z,I've been learning through treehouse but It kind of feels its missing a community so I decided joined  FCC yesterday
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-02T21:30:09.464Z,glad to have you
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-02T21:30:23.418Z,it’s nice to have the FreeCodeCamp/Help channel when you’re stuck on something
gavcooper,2015-01-02T21:30:36.576Z,"I've tried Treehouse before, I get what you mean :)"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-02T21:30:43.208Z,be sure to make use of that once you’ve tried to work through the problem amply on your own
gavcooper,2015-01-02T21:30:45.832Z,"good content, but not much of a community "
Wimsy113,2015-01-02T21:32:38.170Z,Is treehouse any good? I've been looking at starting on there too
benstoltz,2015-01-02T21:34:39.300Z,The content is quite good from what I've worked through thus far.
apexpred,2015-01-02T21:36:43.384Z,yea they high production content with great teachers
benstoltz,2015-01-02T21:37:01.682Z,They also update a tremendous amount.
gavcooper,2015-01-02T21:37:39.235Z,"I joined FCC a couple of weeks ago, but not had much time to work through the material so far - have they got rid of the 'bitballoon' exercises right at the start? I'm seeing links to General Assembly's 'Dash' course instead now? "
gavcooper,2015-01-02T21:38:09.107Z,"(I quite like Codeschool too, btw - I'm doing their Frontend Foundations course at the moment)"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T21:38:41.513Z,"@gavcooper Ya, there was an overhaul of the challenges a couple weeks ago"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T21:38:51.484Z,most of the stuff is all the same
gavcooper,2015-01-02T21:39:20.807Z,Ahhh. 
apexpred,2015-01-02T21:39:22.746Z,yea codeschool is great too but I would say treehouse has better instructors
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T21:40:11.975Z,@apexpred that's why treehouse is a paid service
gavcooper,2015-01-02T21:40:32.504Z,I think treehouse cover a wider range of topics too
apexpred,2015-01-02T21:40:54.462Z,"so is codeschool, they just a some free content aswell"
apexpred,2015-01-02T21:41:30.334Z,man I can't type complete sentances today
Wimsy113,2015-01-02T21:44:41.319Z,Code school has paid content too
benstoltz,2015-01-02T21:45:16.250Z,"Code school tends to focus on more higher end content, specifically oriented around development. "
benstoltz,2015-01-02T21:45:32.166Z,"Treehouse has design, business, etc as well."
benstoltz,2015-01-02T21:46:29.306Z,"And is more oriented around a well rounded approach to learning. That being said their mid level dev/high end dev content is much sparser then Codeschool. Also it tends to be in 'workshop' form, meaning it requires a gold membership"
benstoltz,2015-01-02T21:46:59.384Z,Another resource (imo better then code school) is https://frontendmasters.com/courses/ 
apexpred,2015-01-02T21:49:23.821Z,@keyframes not supported in an inline or scoped stylesheet in Firefox
apexpred,2015-01-02T21:49:37.743Z,thats why my robot doesn't have red eyes
apexpred,2015-01-02T21:49:51.053Z,disapointed
tania531,2015-01-02T21:58:09.784Z,Hi I'm just now joining this - looks like a great resource
benstoltz,2015-01-02T21:59:25.434Z,Welcome Tania!
odrisck,2015-01-02T21:59:47.741Z,welcome to our community @tania531 
odrisck,2015-01-02T21:59:57.082Z,how did you hear about FCC
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-02T22:00:06.422Z,@odrisck  ;)
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-02T22:00:26.260Z,Welcome @tania531!
Maximization,2015-01-02T22:00:59.144Z,@apexpred what are you getting instead?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-02T22:01:16.887Z,@apexpred @Wimsy113 @benstoltz Woops! I read codeschool as _codecademy_
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-02T22:01:55.004Z,@apexpred I had many problems with the Dash tasks running javascript correctly. You can always check your stuff in Codepen to see if it's correct.
apexpred,2015-01-02T22:02:51.813Z,"Just switched over to chrome, all is good now"
apexpred,2015-01-02T22:04:10.763Z,caniuse.com is great 
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-02T22:05:32.640Z,The first task for every lesson in the Chrome Dev Tools course is always completed before I start it. Anyone else see this?
Maximization,2015-01-02T22:06:21.354Z,"@AnthonyIsaacs yup, it's a bug relaoding the page fixes the problem"
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-02T22:08:21.102Z,Thanks
tania531,2015-01-02T22:13:51.958Z,thanks for the warm welcome - I'm truly just starting now
codefernandes,2015-01-02T22:33:40.913Z,Hi friends.  Starting FreeCodeCamp.  :smile: 
benstoltz,2015-01-02T22:34:13.708Z,Welcome Marcelo :)
odrisck,2015-01-02T22:34:31.687Z,hello there @codefernandes 
apexpred,2015-01-02T22:35:51.307Z,Welcome

benstoltz,2015-01-02T22:59:42.927Z,Anyone have fun plans for their weekend?
piecedigital,2015-01-02T23:20:54.128Z,@benstoltz Sketch for logo design
jsonify,2015-01-02T23:30:38.416Z,"I just heard the phrase ""a lot of API usage these days."" Can someone explain an example of all this usage"
benstoltz,2015-01-02T23:34:26.332Z,"There are a lot of companies, organizations, etc that produce data API’s that then developers will tend to use. For example you want to integrate twitter into your application, you need to use their API."
benstoltz,2015-01-02T23:34:40.337Z,"Same thing goes for things like 4square, Facebook logins, etc."
benstoltz,2015-01-02T23:35:04.196Z,So there’s going to be a lot of useage of those kinds of things. 
benstoltz,2015-01-02T23:36:12.366Z,"Also if you are talking about data, say it congressional info. You’re not going to gather it yourself. You’ll go to an organization that already gathers that data, cleans it properly, and sends it out as an API so it’s easily accessible, digestible, and you don’t have to worry about storing all that data, ala the Sunlight Foundation."
benstoltz,2015-01-02T23:36:18.275Z,Does that make sense?
GrahamFischer,2015-01-02T23:41:34.275Z,"Hello all, I have a question regarding the responsive blog challenge, is this the right chatroom to ask?"
RussEby,2015-01-02T23:41:42.894Z,"If I can through in an example of API, the company I work for does Telematics monitoring. We gather information about engines/vehicles/equipment and store it in a database. Some of our customers use our software to access it, but we are getting more customers that are creating their own software/websites and using our API to gather the data. "
RussEby,2015-01-02T23:45:42.722Z,@GrahamFischer I'm pretty sure whatever question you have someone in here could answer it. There is some very smart people in here. (and if they don't know they may be able to point you in the right direction)
piecedigital,2015-01-02T23:45:59.735Z,@GrahamFischer The help chat is technically the room you should visit but I can help you here
JohnQQ,2015-01-02T23:47:17.880Z,"Just finished ""jQuery FCC"" exercises.. Had to go through jQuery API.DOC few times :) , overall I'm a little sad there's only 13 exercises.. Should add more perhaps? +1"
cshutchinson,2015-01-02T23:48:38.135Z,jumping into ChromeDevTools tonight ....here I go
JohnQQ,2015-01-02T23:50:28.863Z,"@cshutchinson It's pretty glitchy, you might wanna refresh page if things get quirky! Worked for me."
cshutchinson,2015-01-02T23:51:04.386Z,@JohnQQ thanks for the heads up
GrahamFischer,2015-01-03T00:14:44.692Z,"@piecedigital Well, I'm not stuck. Its a question of css code placement. When changing the color of an h1 tag using CSS, I can place the code ""color: white;"" in either the <header> tag, or in the referent <h1> tag. Does it matter where I put the color code snippet? "
TravisMaloney,2015-01-03T00:15:20.758Z,Did freecodecamp recently update?
GrahamFischer,2015-01-03T00:15:26.326Z,PS. Thanks for the help!
TravisMaloney,2015-01-03T00:15:35.728Z,I think it used to have Codecademy HTML and CSS but now it looks like it doesn't?
benstoltz,2015-01-03T00:15:53.766Z,@TravisMaloney It did update recently from what I understand.
TravisMaloney,2015-01-03T00:16:34.008Z,"New year, new FreeCodeCamp I guess! Thanks @benstoltz "
benstoltz,2015-01-03T00:16:40.171Z,@GrahamFischer in that particular assignment I believe they want it in the <style> tag in the <head>.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T00:17:10.126Z,When actuallllly coding you’re going to want to put all your CSS in stylesheets so it’s not in your HTML pages at all.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T00:17:31.607Z,(ie when not doing a site like Dash)
benstoltz,2015-01-03T00:23:55.319Z,Does that answer your question @GrahamFischer ?
GrahamFischer,2015-01-03T00:24:28.124Z,@benstoltz Thanks for the reply Ben.  
benstoltz,2015-01-03T00:25:02.327Z,"np :) if the assignment is giving you trouble, just let us know what it is doing and we’ll try to help out"
GrahamFischer,2015-01-03T00:26:03.681Z,@benstoltz Yes it does. I had a long reply typed out trying to further clarify my question but then looked at the code again and realized what you meant. I made the correction to my code and the color for <h1> is now under style. Thanks!
benstoltz,2015-01-03T00:26:50.762Z,My pleasure! :)
GrahamFischer,2015-01-03T00:27:02.511Z,Its nice to have a chatroom to work with others in realtime!!
MychaelZ,2015-01-03T00:55:37.870Z,"hey im trying to rewrite javascipts pop method
i saw the code from the V8 engine but they were using functions that im not familiar with
i wanted to know if there was a simple way to write it
the only thing i am stuck on is mutating the original array
for ex
 ```
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.pop();
console.log(arr)
// output [1,2]
```
how do i get it to remove the element from the arr variable"
teddy-error,2015-01-03T01:06:38.044Z,Not sure what you expected to happen Mychael. That is the correct output for the pop function called on your array

cheezedigital,2015-01-03T01:18:32.697Z,yo yo
trisell,2015-01-03T01:19:26.407Z,For those of you far enough to be into Node.js development. Enjoy this article. And may it save you time!!! https://www.airpair.com/node.js/posts/top-10-mistakes-node-developers-make
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T01:25:01.339Z,"not a bad article, but if you follow the node tutorial on codeschool and nodeschool you should **never** be doing some of those things anyway"
cshutchinson,2015-01-03T01:51:58.464Z,@cheezedigital hi welcome!
odran037,2015-01-03T02:00:16.700Z,"@MychaelZ ""how do i get it to remove the element from the arr variable"" which element are you referring to specifically?"
MychaelZ,2015-01-03T02:01:41.672Z,the last element of the array
odran037,2015-01-03T02:04:34.144Z,.pop() is the correct function for that. It removes the last item. Are you trying to remove it and use it instead of doing away with it altogether? 
odran037,2015-01-03T02:07:32.547Z,"The code you pasted above will change your array into [1, 2] as you noted but if you want to use the '3' consider assigning the pop() method to a variable."
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:39:46.815Z,why in codeschool tryJQuery do the slides show single quotes but then exercises require double quotes?
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:40:19.945Z,They actually make you do double quotes? I’ve never seen Codeschool enforce things that tough.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:40:27.391Z,Strictly*
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:42:05.108Z,"yes the answers are in double quotes, not sure if that's why I get some of the coding wrong but the answer is always different then the slides that show single quotes"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:42:53.057Z,"Realistically it doesn’t matter, apparently outside their overly strict validator."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:43:07.868Z,From a coding perspective I mean.
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:45:07.226Z,so in jQuery single quotes or double quotes are the same?
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:46:39.663Z,"$(document).ready(function() {
 $('button').on('click', function() {
 var price = $('<p>From $399.99</p>');
 $('.vacation').append(price);
application.js
The price will be appended to both
.vacation elements

}); from the slide"
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:47:39.577Z,"from the answer (not the exact exercise):$(document).ready(function(){
  $(""button"").on(""click"", function(){
    var message = $(""<span>Call 1-555-jquery-air to book this tour</span>"");
    $(this).closest("".tour"").append(message);
    $(this).remove();
  });
});
"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:47:59.015Z,So
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:48:24.751Z,"Realistically it will function with either “ or ‘. Looking into it more, Jquery recommends using """
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:48:57.283Z,"Reasoning being that something like: 
alert('Say ""Hello""');
alert(""Say 'Hello'"");"
yaskyj,2015-01-03T02:49:14.722Z,Actually Google's Javascript style guide single quotes are preferred when creating strings: https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml?showone=Strings#Strings
yaskyj,2015-01-03T02:49:35.952Z,Which I always find strange.
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:49:38.363Z,soooo why wouldn't the slides teach the recommended/correct way
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:49:40.362Z,The second one reads easier. Also if you start working with JSON it requires “. So for consistencies sake...
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:49:51.075Z,Because ultimately it’s the programmers preference.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:50:06.634Z,The slides may have been prepared by someone different from the challenge
hallfox,2015-01-03T02:51:06.572Z,Also many other languages require double quotes.
hallfox,2015-01-03T02:51:41.917Z,"Which is why I always feel bothered when using single quotes for strings in JavaScript or Python, for instance."
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:52:20.281Z,"strange, I can't be the only one confused by this.  Double quotes make more sense to me."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:52:56.250Z,"Essentially Javascript is incredibly lax, so much so that you can hang yourself. (Like with == vs === )"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:53:10.129Z,And people do their own weird things with the language.
piecedigital,2015-01-03T02:53:32.872Z,I typically only use single quotes when I'm feeling too lazy to hold shift. Other than that I use doubles when there's a likely hood of my creating a string.
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:55:38.416Z,I can't recall if I was specifically dinged for the quotes but  just find it annoying the teaching slides and the answers don't match.
odrisck,2015-01-03T02:56:01.629Z,I don't recall having the issue of the slides not matching
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:57:28.386Z,If you ever want to see something really annoying/weird with JS try this:
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:57:33.721Z,http://try.jquery.com/levels/3/sections/15  look at the slides and then look at the answers but I did cut and paste it above
benstoltz,2015-01-03T02:57:57.286Z,(0.1 + 0.2) === 0.3;
Kadams223,2015-01-03T02:58:06.995Z,You can look at any of the slides and answers none of them match
Kadams223,2015-01-03T03:00:16.715Z,@benstoltz what will that do?  
benstoltz,2015-01-03T03:00:26.625Z,Come back with a False.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T03:00:32.804Z,Because JS is neurotic.
odrisck,2015-01-03T03:00:42.497Z,"interesting, and you are being marked wrong for not using double quotes?"
hallfox,2015-01-03T03:00:44.992Z,@benstoltz  That's floating point rounding error. It plagues more languages than JS.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T03:01:17.250Z,Which others out of curiosity? I mainly work with JS and python so it’s a quirk of JS to me.
jordanw,2015-01-03T03:02:25.826Z,Did the node.js tutorials at codeschool use to be free?
hallfox,2015-01-03T03:02:28.233Z,"It's does the same thing in Python, I just checked."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T03:02:34.155Z,Really?
hallfox,2015-01-03T03:02:36.906Z,Yeah.
Kadams223,2015-01-03T03:03:00.185Z,@odrisck I'm not 100% sure anymore my brain hurts from jQuery.  But I did either pass or fail and continue on only to see the answers were double quotes
benstoltz,2015-01-03T03:03:32.723Z,I….how the heck did I never notice this.
hallfox,2015-01-03T03:03:40.870Z,It's not a language thing though. It's more of a CS thing. Has to do with the fact that you can't represent fractional decimal numbers in binary very well.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T03:03:47.953Z, /nods
hallfox,2015-01-03T03:03:57.367Z,It's like how 1/3 = 0.333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333

Drew-B,2015-01-03T04:53:32.117Z,Just started. 
benstoltz,2015-01-03T04:53:34.703Z,Greetings @Deceptivesmiles Glad to have you. :)
Drew-B,2015-01-03T04:53:52.843Z,Thanks @benstoltz I appreciate it
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T04:54:04.578Z,@Deceptivesmiles Fun name. Welcome to our community
hallfox,2015-01-03T04:54:12.160Z,Cool. Welcome aboard.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T04:54:26.006Z,"If you have any questions or need any help, don’t hesitate to ask."
Drew-B,2015-01-03T04:54:26.286Z,Thanks @hallfox 
Drew-B,2015-01-03T04:55:10.042Z,"Thanks, I appreciate it. Been reading books and on Codeacademy but this is a better option outside of formal education."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T04:55:52.021Z,Agreed. Structure and an active community who is working through things at the same time as you are is very helpful.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T04:56:15.932Z,"So out of curiosity, where are you at @hallfox ?"
apexpred,2015-01-03T04:56:22.172Z,"Why are some people againts relying heavily on javascript, never understood that. Never met someone who disables javascript"
hallfox,2015-01-03T04:57:16.198Z,Me? I'm working through the mad libs project on Dash.
hallfox,2015-01-03T04:57:33.128Z,I'm also helping someone out with JS.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T04:57:45.221Z,"Cool, are you a comp sci student out of curiosity?"
hallfox,2015-01-03T04:57:49.104Z,Since I have more experience with JS than web dev.
hallfox,2015-01-03T04:57:55.395Z,I am.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T04:58:17.756Z,"Shiny. I’m a GIS student, if you are familiar with that field."
hallfox,2015-01-03T04:59:03.592Z,I am not.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T04:59:43.292Z,"Geographic information systems. So spatial analysis, cartography, etc. My specific area of interest is geospatial web dev, aka web mapping applications."
apexpred,2015-01-03T05:00:12.419Z,that sounds awesome
hallfox,2015-01-03T05:00:28.105Z,"@apexpred  I don't think anyone's against having JS in the browser, as it's very useful (although there are a few paranoid people who would disagree). It's more about how certain developers feel about the language design."
hallfox,2015-01-03T05:00:50.938Z,@benstoltz  Cool.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T05:01:02.108Z,"It’s a pretty awesome field. GIS is applicable to nearly every current industry + gov + science, etc. So if you get bored in one area you can easily shuffle over to something else."
hallfox,2015-01-03T05:02:00.485Z,"Sounds nice. I'm CS all the way, though, but I'm sure our fields intersect."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T05:03:25.270Z,"Significantly. Mine edges more towards the side of Data science, when you’re talking about doing pure spatial analysis/visualization. But you can have any part of the spectrum from pure geography/theory with minimal programming on up to full data science, development, web dev"
hallfox,2015-01-03T05:03:56.413Z,@apexpred  Namely because some of the wat things in JS. Also certain people have very particular opinions on weak dynamically typed languages.
apexpred,2015-01-03T05:05:20.307Z,@hallfox yea I came from first learning programming in c++ and javascript was the strangest thing to me at first
hallfox,2015-01-03T05:06:06.141Z,JS was pretty much an object of hate for me until a little while ago.
hallfox,2015-01-03T05:06:17.946Z,Until I discovered Node

benstoltz,2015-01-03T05:07:46.879Z,Nice @MychaelZ . it’s a pretty fun field. Plus you get to make maps…which is just awesomely fun.
MychaelZ,2015-01-03T05:07:56.858Z,Yes and application is everywhere

apexpred,2015-01-03T05:09:53.896Z,2 months for me
hallfox,2015-01-03T05:10:01.711Z,"Hmm, I picked up JS about a year and a half ago."
MychaelZ,2015-01-03T05:10:08.383Z,oh cool!

iyeager2004,2015-01-03T06:52:53.160Z,KSP is an addiction. I'm currently on the wagon while working FCC.
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T06:52:57.307Z,the movie
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T06:53:08.418Z,It has also made me hate gravity.
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T06:53:11.898Z,The physics.
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T06:53:14.706Z,the force?
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T06:53:16.524Z,:)
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T06:53:18.886Z,yeah that too
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T06:53:34.198Z,hatesez them both
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T06:53:46.997Z,do you follow Scott Manley on youtube?
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T06:54:44.234Z,Nope. Should I?
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T06:55:29.776Z,A self-proclaimed astronomogamer...? This looks interesting.
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T06:57:37.578Z,"interesting guy, very smart, and incredibly good at the game"
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T06:59:23.162Z,Watching his Rosetta reenactment now.
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T06:59:41.934Z,Seems like a good way to decompress from Coderbyte challenges.
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T07:01:01.153Z,"yeah, they’re kind of nice. I’ve been following his interstellar quest series since he began it over a year ago now"

Shumbasdad,2015-01-03T11:06:35.517Z,The slideshow will not start 
Maximization,2015-01-03T11:07:38.053Z,what browser and version are you using?
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T11:10:14.796Z,@Shumbasdad what browser are you using?

terakilobyte,2015-01-03T11:48:15.864Z,anyone want to see a tightly compact kata monster?

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T11:51:02.187Z,@terakilobyte  what?
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T11:51:37.926Z,"```
function ipToInt32(ip){

Maximization,2015-01-03T11:52:33.168Z,haha
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T11:53:04.092Z,I really do love JS
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T11:53:06.775Z,:confused: 
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T11:53:51.626Z,it converts an ipv4 internet address into its true 32 bit integer form
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T11:53:52.462Z,I'm almost out of Internet data
Maximization,2015-01-03T11:54:04.623Z,the irony of JS is that is it's not beginner friendly but becomes easy to use when you're better at it
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T11:56:26.048Z,oooh someone else wrote a great solution I didn’t even think about
Maximization,2015-01-03T11:57:38.618Z,how does it look
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T11:58:20.598Z,"elegant, I didn’t realize you could split numbers into an array using the split() function, makes sense now though"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T11:58:33.137Z,"`return ip.split(""."").reduce(function(int,v){ return int*256 + +v } );`"
Maximization,2015-01-03T12:01:56.452Z,you can use .split() on a Number data type?
Maximization,2015-01-03T12:02:03.631Z,can't find that in the api
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T12:03:35.280Z,it looks like it converts it to an array of strings
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T12:04:00.368Z,given the notation on v
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T12:06:08.401Z,"not terribly memory efficient, but it works!"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T12:08:32.321Z,"available to pair if anyone wants to work on their coderbyte challenges or anything else, really"
Maximization,2015-01-03T12:17:02.528Z,"I'm working on the last two FCC challenges now, want to finish that first before doing coderbyte"
Maximization,2015-01-03T12:17:32.375Z,"maybe a bit later if you're still available, or if someone else grabs you first :smile: "
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T12:22:21.807Z,@Maximization sure
Maximization,2015-01-03T12:26:10.647Z,"I recall you mentioning that you don't like angular.js that much and that you prefer meteor instead, why is that?"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T12:40:33.061Z,@Maximization that’s @sircharleswatson I believe 
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T12:40:36.456Z,I like angular just fine
Maximization,2015-01-03T12:42:59.332Z,"ahh then I was confused, saw you both chatting about it"
Maximization,2015-01-03T12:44:32.066Z,"angular seems pretty neat, need to practice a bit to get a feeling for using directives, controllers etc."
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T12:56:40.947Z,yeah
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T12:56:49.419Z,I like angular alot actually

seahik,2015-01-03T13:37:08.663Z,@Spressord  hi ya welcome
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T13:37:58.561Z,"@seahik yep, it’s a badger, though that’s an old photo and the new one isn’t populating across gitter it seems"
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:38:13.437Z,Good day everyone!
seahik,2015-01-03T13:39:34.858Z,ive never seen a live badger unfortunately just ones on road :worried: 
seahik,2015-01-03T13:40:13.187Z,hey ya @TobogganMD 
seahik,2015-01-03T13:40:28.766Z,haha are ya cold i norge?
seahik,2015-01-03T13:40:59.927Z,its warmed up here in småland actually all the snow melted on new years day
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:42:04.119Z,I'm actually in halland right now
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:42:13.503Z,at my parents'
seahik,2015-01-03T13:42:32.656Z,ah ok did you get a lot of snow there on christmas_
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:42:38.997Z,"it's really mild here, but we've had a lot of wind"
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:42:46.320Z,no snow really
seahik,2015-01-03T13:42:48.108Z,yes here too really windy yesterday
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:43:17.932Z,"I was down by the ocean yesterday, you could barely walk directly against the wind"
seahik,2015-01-03T13:43:20.419Z,"ah ok, we got quite a bit over christmas but now its gone"
seahik,2015-01-03T13:43:26.064Z,oh wow i bet
seahik,2015-01-03T13:45:54.304Z,@TobogganMD any luck on starting on a small project? wasn't it you i was talking about difficulty starting yesterday?
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:46:50.313Z,I made a simple static website to figure out how well I understand HTML/CSS
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:47:01.053Z,positioning is a bit complicated still
seahik,2015-01-03T13:47:05.542Z,ah nice
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:47:20.076Z,gonna add some functional buttons with jQuery to it next
seahik,2015-01-03T13:47:26.441Z,yes its harder once you start doing it yourself without bootstrap  etc
seahik,2015-01-03T13:47:31.100Z,nice
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:47:53.884Z,though I've come to realize that I have no clue how to design a website
seahik,2015-01-03T13:48:37.074Z,yeah i get worried that you need to have an artistic eye
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T13:49:05.280Z,plenty of inspiration in the interwebs
seahik,2015-01-03T13:49:06.421Z,but i think with practice can make some decent looking sites
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:49:30.069Z,yeah definitely
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:49:46.959Z,you don't have to be a designer if you don't want to as well
seahik,2015-01-03T13:53:03.605Z,yeah thats righ but maybe good start with html/css to get to know that part
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:54:33.230Z,yeah I figured I didn't want to move forward without feeling relatively confident with it
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:54:53.838Z,doesn't seem to be any more html/css later on in the challenges
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:55:05.755Z,except for bootstrap
seahik,2015-01-03T13:57:05.797Z,ah yeah im thinking the same way...ive done 30+ of the challenges but I want to be sure to start using the stuff im learning so i dont forget it
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:57:32.625Z,"yeah, remembering is the hard part"
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T13:57:48.958Z,I'm taking this course now to help a little bit with that: https://www.coursera.org/course/learning
seahik,2015-01-03T13:57:54.369Z,"i think if you practice with it, it solidifies"
seahik,2015-01-03T13:59:05.686Z,ah nice do you like it?
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T14:00:13.960Z,"haven't really started yet, gonna check out the first lectures today"
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T14:00:27.166Z,but I've read good things about it
seahik,2015-01-03T14:01:38.556Z,"ah great, i wonder if there is stuff written on self-paced learning"
seahik,2015-01-03T14:02:04.809Z,the challenges you face when trying to educate yourself with online tools and books
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T14:03:16.210Z,"probably not that much yet, since it's so new"
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T14:03:56.838Z,all the research is focused on classical education when it comes to pedagogy
seahik,2015-01-03T14:06:35.532Z,i remember seeing a link on reddit that supposedly had a full CS degree that was available through different free courses online.  that would be amazing if someday that route is considered close to one from a real uni
seahik,2015-01-03T14:07:04.160Z,i also read that people sign up for MOOCs but that only 15% finish them
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T14:07:18.167Z,sounds accurate
seahik,2015-01-03T14:07:24.539Z,it was something about that if you pay for a course your more likely to finish it
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T14:07:29.112Z,I've never finished a MOOC course myself
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:08:11.266Z,a good github profile and recommendations form actual work can be more valuable than a cs degree
seahik,2015-01-03T14:08:12.926Z,doesn't codeacadamy count? :-)
TobogganMD,2015-01-03T14:08:32.672Z,"I guess, then I've finished two and a half :)"
seahik,2015-01-03T14:08:33.782Z,@terakilobyte I've heard that for sure
seahik,2015-01-03T14:09:34.768Z,Would you say that the Uni route is more common though for IT professionals?
seahik,2015-01-03T14:11:53.222Z,"I guess what Im saying is it would be cool, if there was a program one could follow online that would lead to work.  (maybe its freecodecamp?)"
seahik,2015-01-03T14:12:55.624Z,A CS degree offers a track to follow and you often are forced to do projects that can build your portfolio and give you experience.
seahik,2015-01-03T14:13:03.854Z,(but costs money)
cshutchinson,2015-01-03T14:13:48.628Z,@seahik I was assigned a MOOC on web access ability at work.... over 500 signed up and about 5 people actually completed it (it required a bit of work most people weren't interested in doing!)
seahik,2015-01-03T14:13:52.954Z,"For myself and I imagine others, it's hard to create your own self-study track to get to a point where you have a strong github profile and are contributing to open source projects."
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T14:15:09.474Z,"@terakilobyte So, yeah, thanks for the Scott Manley tip. I'm now catching up on the Interstellar videos while working challenges. :+1: "
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:16:32.547Z,@iyeager2004 np
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:17:03.948Z,"I’ve also been geeking out on old computers like bombe (ok not a computer), colossus, the apollo guidance, all that"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:17:34.518Z,amazing to think the average phone in a pocket is orders of magnitude more powerful than all those combined
seahik,2015-01-03T14:17:54.469Z,@cshutchinson  MOOCs are such a cool idea. It's like wow free education...sign me up!
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T14:18:28.380Z,"Yeah, was gonna say, the Raspberry Pi sitting on my desk right now is like all of those times 1000"
seahik,2015-01-03T14:18:29.290Z,(especially if your from the US where education costs a fortune)
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:19:01.485Z,"@seahik I don’t think there are any non-traditional avenues that guarantee a job in any field. That said, hard work and talent will get you into any career field you choose, regardless of how you learn the material"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:19:20.556Z,"if you show that you are just **better**, it’s a no brainer for an employer"
seahik,2015-01-03T14:20:42.058Z,@terakilobyte I completey agree.  I think its just hard for the average joe to organize one's self to self-teach.  I think it would be great if online resources really evolve to make it easier to self-teach.
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T14:23:17.144Z,"Learning how to learn is the hardest step. Once you have that figured out you can get to pretty much anything you want. If you want an actual success story, I'm in the bay area working full-time as a firmware developer using C/C++ and the highest degree I hold is an Associates degree in Industrial Management. "
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:23:23.482Z,"@seahik the benefit of choosing your own path is that you can determine what to focus on. You should want to broaden just to be a better person overall (aside from CS you should enroll in moocs that teach communication and math), but if you don’t care about neo-renaissance spackle painting, you won’t be forced to study it and drop a thousand in tuition"
seahik,2015-01-03T14:23:49.670Z,wow nice @iyeager2004  well done that is inspiring.  how did you go about it...how long did it take you to teach yourself C/C++?  did you take any courses or just from books?  How did you demostrate your expertise to employers?  did you have your own projects?
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T14:24:35.061Z,"Thanks, all done through free resources and probably a little luck."
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:25:03.113Z,ah my other mistress besides JS
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:25:09.562Z,"plain jane, vanilla C"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:25:15.856Z,"C++ is just so, yucky"
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T14:26:36.589Z,"C is as close as I ever want to get to writing assembly. But yeah, there's something so nice about being in control of every aspect of my application. It's like driving some awesome standard shift classic car."
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:26:51.207Z,"or more like C is an expertly honed blade, C++ is the swish army knife with 85^7 implements and weighs eleventythrive millionty pounds"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:26:59.989Z,@terakilobyte You actually learned C! WOW
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:27:10.810Z,I *love* C
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:27:26.241Z,although JS has now surpassed it for my favorite language
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:27:57.393Z,I taught myself C from KnR
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:28:13.578Z,"excellent book, I recommend everyone read it/work through it in their spare time"
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T14:28:48.636Z,JS seems like fun. I'm enjoying playing around in jQuery. Just started the Node.js stuff.
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:29:04.202Z,Node is awesome
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:29:20.967Z,"and once you get the idea of closures, like really really get it, and that **everything** is an object"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:29:30.348Z,it just becomes magical
cshutchinson,2015-01-03T14:29:36.229Z,@terakilobyte one of my favorite programming books I've purchased 
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:29:42.914Z,JS in general. I just view node as a tool
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:30:15.704Z,@cshutchinson it’s amazing comparing it to modern “learn to program” books
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:30:46.934Z,"it’s just right to the point, with enough explanation to give you a warm fuzzy but leaving it open enough you have to do it yourself to really understand what they mean"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:31:43.357Z,and then understanding pointers and why they are amazing(ly awful if misused)
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:32:38.658Z,"@AmmarAliShah why is that wow that I learned C, btw? :)"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:32:50.900Z,it also has tainted me to dislike python and ruby
cshutchinson,2015-01-03T14:32:59.709Z,"it was amazing resource back when I was doing AVR development...actually thinking I could turn that into a career, but an incredibly fun hobby"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:34:45.760Z,@terakilobyte C isn't Object Oriented
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:34:53.981Z,It's a har language to learn
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:34:58.086Z,haed*
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:35:00.701Z,hard*
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:35:11.911Z,"@AmmarAliShah on the contrary, I think procedural programming is much easier to learn initially"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:35:37.254Z,I tried C++
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:35:46.147Z,Couldn't get it done
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:35:55.076Z,Went with Python insted :D
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:36:50.911Z,@AmmarAliShah how do you tie your shoes?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:37:22.631Z,@terakilobyte I just learned that 4 years ago!
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:38:31.639Z,"a bit rhetorical :) What I’m getting at is, you probably follow some procedure and manually tie them yourself vs. something like shoe.tie();"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:41:52.809Z,Why do you hate Python and Ruby?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:42:12.077Z,I like Python and plan on learning Ruby after jQuery
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:42:44.666Z,"honestly? Call me petty, but I dislike their syntax"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:43:44.678Z,Python's syntax dtaes back to Algol 68 and Lua
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:43:49.537Z,dates*
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:45:33.838Z,"Ok, that does nothing to alter my dislike for the syntax though"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:46:00.602Z,It has a simple syntax why do you hate it
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:46:40.307Z,because there’s something nice in defining blocks of execution within {}
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:46:45.980Z,"```
print(""I'm Python!"")
```"
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:46:47.968Z,it’s very clear
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:50:02.387Z,No {} is good? 
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T14:54:02.262Z,I’m not saying whether it is or isn’t absolutely. I’m saying personally I like the syntax of C style languages. I look for () {} as that’s what I’m used to
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:57:02.466Z,C is influincing you too much
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:57:09.556Z,I'm on firefox now
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:57:18.792Z,My keyboard isn't working in chrome
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T14:57:23.270Z,that's odd
terakilobyte,2015-01-03T15:02:34.253Z,"@AmmarAliShah perhaps it is influencing you too little… and yeah, that’s strange"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T15:03:05.173Z,Back on Chrome
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-03T15:03:20.824Z,Restarted my computer

seahik,2015-01-03T15:31:25.719Z,Is there a way to mark them as 'not done'?

serhiicss,2015-01-03T15:37:09.635Z,The reason I think web development is amazing is because it allows you to create things the whole world is able to see!
Nocando,2015-01-03T15:37:23.092Z,Im from the west coast
seahik,2015-01-03T15:37:35.419Z,@Nocando i'm just starting as well.  although took some programming courses several years ago...but new to web stuff

seahik,2015-01-03T15:39:20.496Z,the only person I knew that did that effectively was this super intelligent classmate.  he would wake up with ideas and work on them
Nocando,2015-01-03T15:39:55.700Z,Haha it's a great feeling. I would never go back to sleeping normal
seahik,2015-01-03T15:40:37.498Z,ah thats great...whatever works!

benstoltz,2015-01-03T15:58:50.974Z,That particular challenge seems bugged. Try a different browser
Nocando,2015-01-03T16:00:31.990Z,"@benstoltz Planning to code all day if I don't get distracted.... I want to learn as much as possible. It's telling me ""Your script tag looks good, but don't forget to add a tag to close it."""

Nocando,2015-01-03T16:01:08.689Z,I'll just skip it

ewatuteja,2015-01-03T16:36:33.062Z,you like it?

QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T16:39:40.082Z,@ewatuteja These visualizations look beautiful. Have you put any visualizations on Plot.ly?
benstoltz,2015-01-03T16:40:35.459Z,"Aye! I started with GIS and then started playing around with web dev…and now I want to do web GIS. Figure I can branch out in either direction, GIS or dev."

ewatuteja,2015-01-03T16:43:07.555Z,"Thanks so much @QuincyLarson! :) Nope, nothing up on Plot.ly yet. Could I put d3.js viz up there? @benstoltz, are you making progress in the bootcamp? How far are you?"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T16:44:38.210Z,"Up to #13, started yesterday. If you do d3.js stuff I don’t forsee you having any troubles :)"

QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T17:07:05.786Z,"@ewatuteja Unfortnately, It will probably be tabular and narrative-based (I don’t have data visualization skills). Maybe you could give me some feedback as to how I could make it more intriguing from a presentation perspective?"

odrisck,2015-01-03T17:51:31.362Z,Morning Steven :)
Nocando,2015-01-03T17:53:47.681Z,time to go back to coding! Had to take a break for my brain to relax.
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T17:54:29.927Z,@StevenKW @odrisck good morning guys!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T17:55:08.105Z,@Nocando I hear you. Shouting is a regular feature of my coding sessions (usually upon breakthrough)
odrisck,2015-01-03T17:55:55.065Z,good morning @QuincyLarson Happy Saturday :)
bboyjacks,2015-01-03T17:57:53.640Z,Do you guys think there are security laws against broadcasting your location to the public? I created an android app that lets people broadcast their location to everyone using the same app. I'm just wondering if this breaks any legal laws or something.
StevenKW,2015-01-03T17:58:21.033Z,Morning @QuincyLarson This was a crazy week. 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T17:59:12.436Z,@StevenKW Tell me about it! What happened on your side of the state?
StevenKW,2015-01-03T17:59:42.549Z,@bboyjacks I am pretty sure if the person knows they are doing it. Don't Facebook and Google and many other apps allow location sharing?
iheartkode,2015-01-03T17:59:51.710Z,Can someone who has a lappy test this: http://codepen.io/iheartkode/full/emzaEm
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T17:59:57.710Z,"@bboyjacks It’s definitely legal. iPhone has a native app that does this. As long as the person broadcasting their location is aware they’re doing so, it’s fine."
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:00:10.806Z,says 100% Mark
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:00:14.814Z,"but I""m always plugged in :)"

odrisck,2015-01-03T18:02:41.707Z,I think its in the bylaws that if you lie about coding you have to brink Kat some cronuts
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:02:50.040Z,lol
Nocando,2015-01-03T18:02:56.507Z,cronuts i see.. lol

StevenKW,2015-01-03T18:03:22.875Z,@QuincyLarson The week just flew by.  I am starting a part time PHP job on Monday so I have been trying to get my PHP skill up to speed. Still trying to figure out how to do both PHP and JS and keep it all straight in my head.

iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:05:52.488Z,lol
bboyjacks,2015-01-03T18:06:04.381Z,What do you guys think is the future of android programming? I started android programming yesterday and I had a lot of fun doing it. I wonder if its a skill worth honing.
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:06:19.938Z,You can make Android apps with JS
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:06:20.647Z,android isn't going anywhere for awhile
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:06:35.055Z,"though I'd lean more to ios, but I'm biased"
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:06:39.201Z,Mobil is here to stay
bboyjacks,2015-01-03T18:07:18.204Z,I see
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:07:44.170Z,Android is here to stay since google owns it.
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:07:59.827Z,"I look at it this way, when was the last time an android phone had users camping out in front of the android store to get their hands on the android on new release :)"
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:08:18.750Z,iphones are too simple for me.
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:08:31.443Z,people that camp out for a phone need a life
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:08:37.003Z,right :)
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:08:52.557Z,I totally didn't stay up till three am refreshing a sales page to get my iphone 6plus
bboyjacks,2015-01-03T18:08:52.757Z,@odrisck That's crazy! Apple has created a cult
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:08:53.529Z,nope
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:08:57.898Z,wasn't me
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:09:40.369Z,Android won't be like that because it's open and anyone can create a phone.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T18:10:00.103Z,Which then introduces issues like ridiculous fragmentation of the OS.
Nocando,2015-01-03T18:10:00.169Z,How old is FFC?
bboyjacks,2015-01-03T18:10:06.258Z,When I can afford an iphone and a macbook then I will get into ios. 
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:10:11.588Z,Since October 
Nocando,2015-01-03T18:10:24.388Z,It's still a baby :o

bboyjacks,2015-01-03T18:11:18.111Z,"i like the iphone, just wish I could afford it."
StevenKW,2015-01-03T18:14:14.058Z,@odrisck how do you like the 6=Plus? I am worried that a phone that large would be a pain to carry around. Does the usability offset the size?
Nocando,2015-01-03T18:16:33.535Z,What does .find() actually do in JQuery
cshutchinson,2015-01-03T18:17:17.892Z,http://api.jquery.com/find/ if you don't mind a lin
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:17:19.618Z,"Its really not a pain to carry, not to me anyways, it did take a little getting use to though"

StevenKW,2015-01-03T18:22:52.393Z,@iheartkode You should do a blog post about coding on the cheap.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T18:22:58.642Z,"Offline documentation for pretty much everything, and it integrates with Alfred and various editors"

StevenKW,2015-01-03T18:25:21.793Z,https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi is pretty cool for the command line.
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:25:31.213Z,"I have, I unintalled it"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T18:25:40.429Z,because of spotlight changes?
odrisck,2015-01-03T18:26:01.982Z,"no because it collected dust, I used when I first installed, just not really anything I need"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T18:26:07.485Z, /nods

SparkyAMG,2015-01-03T18:54:16.884Z,And is there a minimum amount of commitment expected? I love the idea of it but am unsure how much time I'd be able to commit regularly
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:54:33.016Z,team@freecodecamp.com  or @figitalboy  can help if he is around.

SparkyAMG,2015-01-03T18:57:13.610Z,thank you - as I said I love the idea of it and might perhaps look into it properly when I have some time off
iheartkode,2015-01-03T18:58:22.692Z,Sounds Great.
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T19:01:33.983Z,"@SparkyAMG Free Code Camp is for busy people, so yes, all these challenges and nonprofit projects intended to be completed over longer stretches of time"
SparkyAMG,2015-01-03T19:05:49.761Z,@QuincyLarson thanks Quincy - I wasn't sure if they were projects with deadlines etc. They sound ideal if they can be completed around a busy schedule.
Chasecode,2015-01-03T19:08:28.822Z,i think there is a bug with gitter that sometimes doesn't allow to click on things or type
ssuperczynski,2015-01-03T19:12:12.526Z,Hello World!
odrisck,2015-01-03T19:12:26.345Z,Hello @ssuperczynski welcome to FCC
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:12:40.780Z,Welcome @ssuperczynski !
StevenKW,2015-01-03T19:13:54.252Z,Hi There @ssuperczynski 
iheartkode,2015-01-03T19:16:33.315Z,How did you find free code camp?
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T19:16:48.603Z,@ssuperczynski Greetings from San Francisco!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T19:19:04.967Z,"@SparkyAMG There are a lot of great online courses that have fixed schedules. Gradually, Coursera and EdX are realizing that self-paced courses are superior. The theory behind this is simple: Normally, you want a “cohort” of people who go through the entire process together. But with large volumes of students, you can have “flash cohorts” of people who just happen to be at the same point in the course or curriculum at the same time."
SparkyAMG,2015-01-03T19:24:38.974Z,@QuincyLarson I for one am grateful for the self-paced approach :)
Chasecode,2015-01-03T19:25:59.245Z,how do you guys feel about WordPress?
Chasecode,2015-01-03T19:28:02.300Z,I am learning it along side programming languages 
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:30:55.710Z,Hey everyone!
CT5,2015-01-03T19:31:40.223Z,Hello everyone. Just finished the personal page. ![alt](http://awesomescreenshot.com/05a44k9qbb)
iheartkode,2015-01-03T19:31:58.153Z,Awesome!
iheartkode,2015-01-03T19:32:25.334Z,Wordpress  = PHP not a fan
StevenKW,2015-01-03T19:32:43.060Z,Hello @CinnamonB 
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:32:50.283Z,"I agree, not a huge fan of php"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:33:29.980Z,Hey @StevenKW 
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:34:00.974Z,"@iheartkode  I agree, I'm not a fan of PHP, but I did like Wordpress at one point"
BeaCodes,2015-01-03T19:36:14.251Z,Good morning everyone! Happy coding :)
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:36:27.988Z,Good morning :)
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:36:46.758Z,hey @BeaCodes 
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:36:56.042Z,"Errr afternoon now, ha"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:37:38.706Z,@benstoltz :+1: Afternoon
BeaCodes,2015-01-03T19:37:48.825Z,@benstoltz  woops you're right!
Chasecode,2015-01-03T19:37:51.414Z,"i just don't see how i'd ever be able to create a website with all the features wordpress and its plugins offer, and keep them updated, as easily as using wordpress"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:38:20.206Z,"So @CinnamonB I saw yesterday you’re from NYC, whereabouts? I grew up in Sunset Park."
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:38:52.849Z,@benstoltz I'm near Central Park East/West
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:39:19.448Z,"It's bit confusing, so I just say Central Park is right across the street from my house :laughing: "
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:40:02.842Z,Sunset Park as in BK?
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:40:46.182Z,"@CinnamonB Nice. Beautiful area over there. Correct, BK"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:41:17.119Z,@benstoltz True city life. It's a shame I haven't been inside the park in years though.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:41:59.957Z,"—_— You’re crazy, I’d be there constantly if I lived next door (dependent on the area of course)"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:42:43.390Z,I used to work at an art gallery a few blocks from the Met. Miss being able to walk into the park on my lunch breaks.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:43:05.731Z,:laughing: It's like the beginning/end depending on how you look at it. Not downtown but the other end of it.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:43:14.041Z,oooooo
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:43:17.976Z,Yeah I know where you mean.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:43:20.038Z,Oh yea? That must've been something
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:43:56.553Z,"Yeah, I moved art/moved an art library for them over the summer. It was fun work, got to see some amazing art."
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:44:04.729Z,"I don't know. I pass by it, or walk around, but never through it. It's sad. But I should, just not like how it used to be you know."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:44:20.644Z,Yeah.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:44:32.111Z,"I love art. Especially the galleries downtown, I've been to a few."
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:44:57.104Z,"It makes you want to be friends with photogs, they definitely give you a different perspective of life"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:45:30.833Z,Yeah for sure. 
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:46:08.127Z,Le sigh….I miss the city.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:46:27.871Z,I honestly want out :laughing: 
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:46:45.682Z,I’ve been away for > 8 years now.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:46:49.990Z,"Been here all my 20 + years, want to see something else."
sholt1232,2015-01-03T19:47:15.155Z,"""hello world!""."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:47:17.116Z,"Lived in Vermont for 5 years, been here in NC for a long while now too"
luijoy,2015-01-03T19:47:18.997Z,NY?
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:47:22.301Z,Still not used to being away huh.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:47:34.523Z,hey @sholt1232 Welcome to FCC!
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:47:49.842Z,"I am, but I miss it. I miss the train and not having to drive everywhere. I miss the variety of culture and peoples."
StevenKW,2015-01-03T19:47:54.111Z,Welcome to FCC @sholt1232 
GrahamFischer,2015-01-03T19:47:57.047Z,"Hi Ben, I had asked a question here the other day and you suggested that I find another chatroom but I forget what it was called. I think it was something like talk tech?"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:48:31.081Z,"Don’t think it was me, but someone else suggested the FreeCodeCamp/Help chatroom for technical questions"
GrahamFischer,2015-01-03T19:48:51.643Z,That was it. Thanks! 
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:48:58.330Z,"Prices went up here since last you've been. They're raising the fare yet again soon. Plus, they're implementing a Ticket system on the buses. I don't know what for but, I try to stay away from public transit unless absolutely necessary."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:49:01.282Z,Of course :)
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:49:12.859Z,I'd rather pay for a cab. :laughing: 
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:49:17.685Z,Ick that sounds terrible -_-
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:49:47.005Z,"Very much so, I haven't travelled on Bus/Train in a fair amount of months"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:50:10.303Z,What is it up to now per swipe through at the train?
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:50:16.002Z,"If I go somewhere it's usually walking distance, or I'll catch a cab."
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:50:24.553Z,"Uhh, honestly I'm unsure"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:50:38.805Z,Last I was there it was like 3.00 or 4.50...
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:50:51.214Z,"Once 2014 happened, and they raised the fare, they charge us $1 for a metrocard"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:50:59.984Z,Via the subways machine or booth
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:51:05.361Z,-_-
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:51:12.294Z,It's like $5.50 I think
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:51:20.942Z,That’s horrid…..
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:51:28.342Z,No more free transfers from a train to train
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:51:39.822Z,Each new train ride is a new fare
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:51:51.011Z,Unless you transfer within the station
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:52:08.141Z,"Oh okay, was going to say O.o if they charged you in station."
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:52:18.995Z,They do
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:52:51.484Z,"If you're not transferring from one train to the next using stairs to get to another route, or the opposing side, you have to pay again"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:53:05.626Z,Wait so if you took the R in from brooklyn to 14th street and wanted to hop uptown on the N/D they’d charge you again?
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:53:24.344Z,"ah I see, just if you’re going from station to station"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:53:44.102Z,"As long as you can catch the train within, like how you mentioned, you can transfer free"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:54:04.456Z,Still you can go train to train easily then without paying more :P
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:54:25.180Z,"Yep, so you definitely have to know which stops to get off if you want that ""free transfer"" lmaoo"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:54:48.211Z,and the buses are no free transfers
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:54:57.995Z,eh I never took buses anyway
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:55:25.911Z,"If you take one heading downtown, you can't take any of the corresponding buses to go back up, only crosstown buses are free transfers"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:55:44.605Z,"I don't like them, but now I don't like either of them."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:55:47.215Z,Pretty obnoxious….heh
mainevent,2015-01-03T19:55:57.404Z,hi guys! anybody had an issue with ROBOT's eyes animation?
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:55:59.043Z,So if you want to leave NYC where do you want to go instead?
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:56:04.950Z,"Yes, and the service hasn't improved"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:56:12.991Z,I want to travel abroad
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:57:08.359Z,"Nice, where to?"
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:57:30.970Z,I’m hopefully going to either Italy or the Greek Islands in May.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:57:53.227Z,"Not fully decided, but I'd like to see London, Australia, places with cool accents :laughing: "
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:58:23.593Z,I know you're going to have fun no matter where you go.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T19:59:00.222Z,"Oh for certain. The UK was awesome, as was Japan (my previous trips abroad)"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:59:10.609Z,"Change of scenery is always good, helps maintain sanity. That's why I'm trying to work on getting my skills up to par so I can work from anywhere and live a happy relaxing kind of life"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:59:33.627Z,"Lucky you, my last real vacation was over a decade ago."
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T19:59:58.574Z,I'm surprised I'm still sane lmaoo
benstoltz,2015-01-03T20:00:17.943Z,"Well Japan was through school, UK was…two years ago for christmas and new years."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T20:00:37.389Z,I think UK was the only real vacation I’ve ever had.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:01:52.914Z,"Awww, that's nice. My only real vacation was to Jamaica. I went twice, 1st time we stood at a hotel (I went in 3rd grade during thanksgiving, stood for 2 weeks), next time when I was 12. We stood at my gma's house."
steffanigomez323,2015-01-03T20:03:15.561Z,"hi, I'm just a college student trying to learn how to code since I figured out I'm not as good at physics as I thought I was, but turns out coding is just as interesting!"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:03:41.462Z,Welcome to FCC @steffanigomez323 
benstoltz,2015-01-03T20:04:25.746Z,Welcome @steffanigomez323 :)
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:04:28.982Z,welcome to FCC @steffanigomez323 How did you hear about FCC?
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:04:31.775Z,"I actually liked physics for the short time I had it, in school. I'm sure you can use your new coding skills and create something that's physics related."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T20:04:44.015Z,"and I’m off to get lunch, bb in a little while"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:04:52.710Z,Enjoy your lunch
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:05:09.374Z,hey @odrisck how are you?
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:05:22.017Z,"Hey @CinnamonB I'm good, good to see you :) how was your new years?"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:06:11.193Z,"@odrisck likewise. I went to sleep early, wasn't really feeling well but it was a nice and peaceful day with my little family"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:06:24.001Z,How was yours?
steffanigomez323,2015-01-03T20:06:26.351Z,"@odrisck I read an online article (from quartz I believe) where someone basically recommended this site to start learning javascript and all other sorts of things, and so far I like it!"
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:06:44.588Z,we rang in the new year snuggled on the sofa like old folks :) 
steffanigomez323,2015-01-03T20:06:50.404Z,"@CinnamonB turns out I like reading about physics and learning physics, just not doing physics, figures"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:06:55.263Z,"Awww, how cute."
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:07:08.548Z,I'm really glad you found your way here @steffanigomez323 
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:07:29.163Z,I was also logged in here helping out new campers :)
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:08:00.025Z,"@steffanigomez323 Yea, physics can have it's moments. But that's good though, learning and reading about it only builds your knowledge about it. The figures are challenging for sure."
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:08:28.875Z,Oh nice @odrisck Seems like more and more new comers as the days go by.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:08:56.285Z,"@QuincyLarson must be proud of his community, it's pulling together nicely. "
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:09:07.500Z,"Best part, is it's Free."
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:10:07.261Z,"OMG I came across something that was similar to FCC but they charged a min fee of $200 a month, can you believe that. Not everyone can afford that especially with most having student loans, and children to support :laughing: "
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:11:06.392Z,"Yeah I signed on with FCC because I believe in what we are doing here, I think it should be available to everyone"
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:12:13.009Z,I'm also getting involved with a group that teaches code to the poverty stricken as a way to pull themselves out of poverty
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:12:29.667Z,"I truly agree. Also, I like how I get to go through the challenges with ease. Before starting this camp, I was all over the place and it wasn't a main focus to what I wanted to learn. Which sometimes can be a challenge for most, figuring out what to start first and maintain their focus on it."
luijoy,2015-01-03T20:12:36.534Z,I liked the emphasis on completing projects for non-profits. Most other places will teach you one way or another but they aren't concerned with the career aspect. Whereas with FCC it's a core aspect!
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:12:50.755Z,"Oooo, that's amazing @odrisck How's that going thus far?"
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:13:13.071Z,"well I have to learn myself before I can teach, so far I've given money, but eventually I want to actually work with them"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:13:29.047Z,@lui8906 I completely agree with you. And you walk away with more skills to help all types of clients.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:14:05.021Z,"@odrisck :+1: that's great, very inspiring as well."
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:14:09.887Z,"I intend to focus on the children though, specifically girls, but children in at risk communities"
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:15:08.706Z,"public schools have had ot take nearly every extra thing out because of budgets, athletics, music, art and there is very nearly nothing spent on teaching technology as a means to reach up"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:16:38.833Z,"Exactly, and most of the kids are wondering if school was always just about work work work. I feel bad for them, as they won't get to experience the thrill of figuring out what they're skills are and the ability to tap into their creativity unless they take it outside of school, and usually have to pay for it."
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:18:57.031Z,it astounds me that so many companies can understand that we aren't teaching tech engineering enough to provide a good work force in this country but do literally nothing about it
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:19:29.897Z,anyways I'll tuck my soapbox into the corner for now :)
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:20:14.700Z,"But they also need more employees to help their business grow/expand, but I digress. :laughing: "
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:22:07.553Z,"I'm working on challenge #30 it's more advanced than I've ever coded before. And I sometimes look back at the code like ""I coded this?"" lmaoo"
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:22:20.980Z,"hehe, I know the feeling"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:23:24.137Z,"I'm thinking on how I should host my domains I have. Github seems like a good start, same for Heroku, but I'm still not sure."
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:23:37.864Z,I use machighway
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:23:51.449Z,"Don't think I want to spend about $50 for the year, not now actually."
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:24:06.027Z,FCC uses heroku
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:24:10.237Z,Are they prices good? I'm with NameCheap.
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:24:21.544Z,"No way, serious?"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:24:39.147Z,Heroku does static via JS right?
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:24:52.107Z,we pay $120 a year for 5 sites
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:25:08.426Z,I dont know about heroku at all only that FCC is there :)
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:25:21.264Z,sorr we get 4 total domains for $120 a year
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:25:33.953Z,me and bf personally I mean
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:25:52.878Z,That doesn't sound bad.
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:26:11.154Z,"I am not a fan actually, and as I start hosting more apps I may have to go with heroku"
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:26:23.296Z,"I had trouble just installing WP on machighway, it breaks everything"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:26:30.617Z,"Yes, I'd have to agree."
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:26:46.470Z,"Wow, and WP is usually quick to install"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:27:01.416Z,Via cPanel and manually
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:28:02.890Z,"yeah machighway doesn't know what to do with it, and we are looking to move off"
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:28:27.659Z,"good pricing but they've moved their dc twice since we been with, and as a front end dev I can't work with wp on my own shit? not groovy"
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:29:36.414Z,":laughing: They got you very upset. Yep, I don't blame you."
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:29:42.472Z,lol
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:29:52.374Z,"I've been trying to get bf to move for two years, so yeah :)"
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T20:30:02.375Z,"@odrisck I totally get what you're saying about talent, however, the increase in companies outsourcing their training to dev bootcamps is pretty high right now. A friend of mine attended Hackerspace last year and was in a class with 8 facebook employees. Not interns or potentials. Actual employees attending for training. "
CinnamonB,2015-01-03T20:30:08.884Z,"2 Years though, why so long?"
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:30:38.325Z,"Oh I know companies are investing in their current employees, if you don't you are really not going to make it :)"
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T20:30:53.154Z,Truth.
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:31:08.845Z,"I'm specifically talking about investing in the communities you are trying to sell your product to, becoming part of the community rather than milking it dry then moving on seems smarter to me"
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:31:23.997Z,but I'm a hippy born out of time :)
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T20:32:07.010Z,"Right, or we'll see this community collapse like the rest of our employment communities."
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T20:32:29.552Z,There's a high demand for devs right now. I'd like it if that could stay that way. 
towwiow,2015-01-03T20:32:42.669Z,@iyeager2004 - I agree :) 
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T20:32:56.058Z,</soapbox>
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T20:33:08.446Z,This express stuff is fun.
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:33:16.740Z,"the thing is, tech moves very fast, I don't see the need for devs easing off any time soon"
towwiow,2015-01-03T20:33:21.761Z,@odrisck - invested in the community to add value to it is one of the secrets of selling. 
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T20:34:05.975Z,I think I'm gonna build a server for my own personal webpage so my customers can send me a text message straight from the website.
odrisck,2015-01-03T20:34:34.575Z,look at twilio
towwiow,2015-01-03T20:34:38.618Z,"@odrisck - neither do I. Even still with the level of demand, look at the number of members here. The companies who need it far outnumber the talent pool of qualified individuals, and (I believe) the individuals seriously interested and pursuing it."
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T20:34:41.849Z,And have it sync those messages to fogbugz at the same time.

towwiow,2015-01-03T21:07:19.858Z,how can I find out?
towwiow,2015-01-03T21:07:25.522Z,@iyeager2004 
yaskyj,2015-01-03T21:09:23.839Z,@iyeager2004  You can set up the stack on your local and push to Heroku.
TravisMaloney,2015-01-03T21:09:43.117Z,"Hey all, can anyone give me a quick hand with a dash tutorial? I don't know if it's my browser or what, but when the robots eye flashes, it goes from two white eyes to one red eye, and back and froth."
metalhaze,2015-01-03T21:11:29.361Z,The tutorial leaves out info about customizing your background CSS to be two eyes instead of one. You need to edit your background gradient 
Maximization,2015-01-03T21:11:37.932Z,@TravisMaloney insert `background: 75px 150px;` in all the transition codes
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T21:11:59.177Z,It's a bug in dash. You have to specify the background: 75px 150px in all the transitions.
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T21:12:18.497Z,"Dang, @Maximization beat me."
TravisMaloney,2015-01-03T21:13:00.591Z,Thank you kindly!
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T21:13:11.067Z,@towwiow Find out what?
towwiow,2015-01-03T21:13:49.377Z,if my webhost uses MEAN stack @iyeager2004 
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T21:14:41.945Z,"@yaskyj Seems like I'm out of touch with today's terminology. Seems like Heroku is set up to run web-apps, but nowhere does it say they host webpages. Is running web-apps the new way to say hosting a website?"
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T21:15:17.394Z,"@towwiow It would be listed on your webhosts configuration page, or information page. Who do you use?"
yaskyj,2015-01-03T21:17:19.895Z,@iyeager2004 A webapp is just a website connected to a database. There's the server side code and database. Then there's the website part.

odrisck,2015-01-03T21:20:04.232Z,hi there @Ajnin123 welcome to our community!
yaskyj,2015-01-03T21:20:56.174Z,"@iyeager2004 That's why, for instance, you can created a website that just send request and receives responses from the Twitter API. Twitter is serving the requests to your frontend, but you don't have to maintain any server side code."
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T21:23:26.488Z,"Right, I have a company website that I've already developed that just uses HTML5 and CSS, but I'd like to add some other stuff to it with all this new learning I've been doing. Currently I'm hosting on HostGator, but it won't run Node.JS stuff. Heroku can host the website I have, right? Even without anyone 'app' capabilities of it, right?"
towwiow,2015-01-03T21:26:04.055Z,@iyeager2004  -I'm using cpanel.ecowebhost.co.uk - the free hosting you get with the Complete Web Developer course on Udemy
towwiow,2015-01-03T21:26:13.559Z,gotta run! leaving work and catching the wildcard games
benstoltz,2015-01-03T21:28:57.347Z,@iyeager2004 Why do you wish to use Node on a company site out of curiosity? Is it as a project based thing or for a particular reason? Another hosting site to look at is DigitalOcean.
benstoltz,2015-01-03T21:29:06.096Z,$5 a month for basic hosting
benstoltz,2015-01-03T21:29:38.934Z,and it’s a VPS so you can do whatever you want with it
yaskyj,2015-01-03T21:31:18.348Z,^ @iyeager2004 What do you want the database to be holding and serving for the website? Gathering people's sign up information?
iyeager2004,2015-01-03T21:34:53.143Z,"I do software consulting. I have project pages on my website with links to a customers Fogbugz, support resources, etc... It would be nice to use Express and Node to dynamically insert Fogbugz support into the webpage, and maybe even use the Twilio API to let them text me problems, etc..."
benstoltz,2015-01-03T21:36:13.957Z,Take a look at DigitalOcean then.

StevenKW,2015-01-03T21:48:22.552Z,"I'm telling you Gitter needs a <time appropriate greeting> where you type in ""Good <tag> everybody"" and the server displays the correct greeting at the receivers end... They didn't add it to the list. :)"
trisell,2015-01-03T21:55:03.678Z,That would be a require some sort of location identification and way to maintain where somebody is connecting from...not something that most are willing/wanting to have stored somewhere..

StevenKW,2015-01-03T22:16:28.040Z,@trisell I hear ya. I feel like I am becoming an expert tutorial follower. I can't wait to get to the pair programming and the non profit projects. There is where the training wheels will come off.
StevenKW,2015-01-03T22:16:53.698Z,Hello @Swelly and @N0FJ 
yaskyj,2015-01-03T22:17:43.336Z,"@iyeager2004 Admittedly, I don't know exactly what functionality you're trying to add to your site. I was just curious as to what you need to do that can't be accomplished through jQuery ajax/json requests."
cerissa,2015-01-03T22:40:03.867Z,"i feel ya @trisell  im in the same boat as you, im just looking foward to the non profit projects and stuff. then ill really learn"
luijoy,2015-01-03T22:47:09.343Z,@StevenKW totally agree on being an expert tutorial follower. I've just started reading a book called Made To Stick and it is quite insightful on how to learn effectively and is going to change how I learn and follow tutorials from now on. I'm only 10% in and I can already recommend it.
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T22:47:20.717Z,"@trisell Yes, that’s by design. The tutorials aren’t meant to stretch your brain - just to give you a rapid-fire primer. You’ll do tons of open-ended thinking on the projects."
luijoy,2015-01-03T22:48:16.633Z,Sorry the title is actually Make It Stick *
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T22:48:26.113Z,@StevenKW I agree. I tweeted a one-sentence book review earlier today:
QuincyLarson,2015-01-03T22:48:30.599Z,https://twitter.com/ossia/status/551441712011157504
luijoy,2015-01-03T22:50:20.450Z,yeah i get confused between made to stick and make it stick because they have such similar titles but I have them both on my kindle. Haven't read made o stick yet. 
StevenKW,2015-01-03T22:50:44.459Z,@QuincyLarson @lui8906 I'll check out that book. Thanks!
StevenKW,2015-01-03T22:55:51.260Z,How does that book change the way you approach learning?
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:00:27.537Z,"previously I would follow instructions and get really into a topic and learn by repetition and surrounding myself with that topic to ""burn"" it into my memory. "
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:00:38.551Z,in the book they say this is actually not that effective 
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:01:13.677Z,so the traditional way that a book is organised with one chapter for one topic and then the next chapter on another topic goes against how we learn
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:03:14.601Z,"instead they recommend interleaved learning, tackling multiple different topics and having them interspersed. Also always trying to link what you learn with what you already know. as well say when you finish a tutorial, rather than moving onto the next one, test yourself on the knowledge you just learned, ask yourself questions about it, imagine explaining it to someone else etc."
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:03:25.143Z,those are the main things ive picked up so far. 
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:03:59.606Z,Wow thanks thats really helpful!
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:04:22.703Z,currently working through the Learn jQuery CodeSchool section and this question was definitely coming to mind for me.
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:04:48.703Z,Am I learning how to create my own solutions or just learning how their solutions work?
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:05:05.121Z,Although of course at this early stage I'm probably getting a bit ahead of myself :)
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:07:08.287Z,Never to early! ;)
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:07:52.849Z,So as I try to scalp the tl;dr version of the book from you :P
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:08:18.587Z,The idea is to self-question and review as you go through a tutorial rather than simply filling in answers and moving on?
StevenKW,2015-01-03T23:11:32.439Z,"I guess the problem is that you want to move through the material quickly and spending a lot of time reviewing seems like it takes twice as long. I guess if the point is actually learning the material rather than completing the tutorials it's worth the extra time.

The other problem is that a lot of material ""is organised with one chapter for one topic and then the next chapter on another topic""..."
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:12:48.028Z,And the way to combat that would be more review while tying in other learned material I imagine
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:13:01.211Z,"Another thing I noticed about completing online tutorials. I get kind of hooked on the sense of completion. If I'm moving quickly through a course I feel I'm crushing it etc.. But there is no point in completing something if you don't absorb it. An example is the complete web dev course. I'm at the end of the Jquery section completing the code player task. At the outset of the video Rob says to have a go at the project on your own before watching the video. I had a go got half way through just styling it and got really stuck. I think old me would have watched the video, felt I actually did know a lot of what he does and then move on excited to get stuck into the Bootstrap section. But now I'm going to see how he does it and then attempt it again without watching his video. And keep doing it until I can do the whole thing on my own without referring to his video at all. Otherwise whats the point? "
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:13:58.852Z,@BitTinker yep. Can you synthesize what you learned? Put it in your own words? Link it to your current knowledge base? Use it in your own project?
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:14:04.472Z,"In other words, make sure you dont rely on the material so much that its just a crutch and allow yourself to struggle"
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:14:18.227Z,sort of the opposite of what I've been doing with the jQuery exercises :P
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:15:07.124Z,"Yep. Bingo. According to the authors, easy learning = here today, gone tomorrow. when your struggling is when its sticking"
luijoy,2015-01-03T23:15:19.011Z,kind of like lifting weights. the last rep in a set is the one that counts.
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:18:50.780Z,Cool. Looks like I'll be going back through dem tuts!
StevenKW,2015-01-03T23:18:55.360Z,">Another thing I noticed about completing online tutorials. I get kind of hooked on the sense of completion. If I'm moving quickly through a course I feel I'm crushing it etc.. 

I fall into this trap. For example I want to complete the Treehouse tracks. I do  work through and type everything out. I guess I should spend more time on the extra credit steps.

My problem is and remains to be not being able to stick to one thing long enough to master it. I started with Python, moved to PHP, then to JavaScript, and now back to PHP. "
BitTinker,2015-01-03T23:20:20.088Z,"That is why this FCC format is really helping me honestly...having a track laid out for me to follow kind of allows me to banish a bit of the ""ooh shiny!"" temptation."
Swelly,2015-01-03T23:20:42.474Z,I think what has helped me enormously is making something of my own with the knowledge I've gained
Swelly,2015-01-03T23:21:15.613Z,Went through an API learning sprint and came out with this
Swelly,2015-01-03T23:21:15.819Z,https://github.com/Swelly/Versery
Swelly,2015-01-03T23:21:28.936Z,which helped me immensely in terms of holding onto the material I just covered
StevenKW,2015-01-03T23:21:44.762Z,Well I am hoping to do both the FCC and the PHP work. I just need to focus on PHP for now since they are going to pay me to learn.
Swelly,2015-01-03T23:21:48.747Z,Project based learning also builds your portfolio

StevenKW,2015-01-04T00:17:27.968Z,Do any of you use [spritz?](http://www.spritzinc.com/) 
ryanzuwala,2015-01-04T00:26:23.528Z,Hello world! I found freeCodeCamp in a Google search for online boot camps. I'm a developer looking to sharpen my skillset
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:26:36.475Z,Never heard of spritz @StevenKW 
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:26:50.857Z,Welcome @ryanzuwala !
StevenKW,2015-01-04T00:30:03.494Z,Check it out. It lets you read really quickly. I like it because it makes it easier to stay focused while reading.
StevenKW,2015-01-04T00:30:09.468Z,Hello @ryanzuwala 
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:30:22.448Z,Actually my problem is I need to slow down my reading...
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:30:34.059Z,It wouldn’t be good for me to speed it up any further...
StevenKW,2015-01-04T00:30:45.711Z,heh you could pick a slower speed. :)
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:31:03.946Z,haha
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:31:35.079Z,http://iruntheinternet.com/05680 bahaha
cshutchinson,2015-01-04T00:34:51.045Z,@StevenKW it was amazing the faster speeds got easier to read... i maxed out at 350
cshutchinson,2015-01-04T00:35:40.974Z,thanks for sharing that
JohnQQ,2015-01-04T00:39:24.263Z,"nice app @StevenKW , tried it now at 1000 WPM, almost passed out. haha"
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:40:31.122Z,It’s entirely counter to the way I read. Interesting. I look at a page and read the whole thing at once. I don’t read word by word.
Nocando,2015-01-04T00:45:58.193Z,I don't feel confident with traversing the DOM. Should I redo the challenges if I don't feel comfortable?
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:48:35.920Z,"@Nocando Go at the pace you feel comfortable with. If you think you should go through the challenges again then that’s fine, nothing wrong with it. Also you could look up other DOM traversing resources and see if they help fill in the blanks"
StevenKW,2015-01-04T00:49:24.951Z,@benstoltz I wish I could read like that.
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:50:39.299Z,@StevenKW It’s great for pleasure reading but sometimes details can be missed if you’re reading something like a textbook or a scientific journal article. I have to re-read those sometimes.
JohnQQ,2015-01-04T00:54:41.567Z,"@benstoltz Something like photographic memory or? Have you read any ""Speed reading"" books ?"
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:56:13.245Z,"@JohnQQ Neither actually. When I was younger I just taught myself to read this way because I absolutely hated reading. So I looked for ways to expedite the process. So instead of reading word by word, or line by line, I’ll look at the page and sorta read it all at the same time, then move on to the next page."
benstoltz,2015-01-04T00:56:19.328Z,it’s weird/hard to explain
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T02:09:26.611Z,Good evening everyone! I just finished my year end summary blog post

StevenKW,2015-01-04T02:20:08.810Z,@iyeager2004 How did you set up your MEAN stack?
iyeager2004,2015-01-04T02:22:56.579Z,@StevenKW Followed this; https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-a-mean-js-stack-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-server for my Ubuntu laptop. Used this one; https://hackhands.com/how-to-get-started-on-the-mean-stack/ for the Windows 7 laptop and desktop.

iyeager2004,2015-01-04T02:31:53.268Z,@StevenKW I'm thinking I'm liking it. Probably going to switch webhost services to them.

sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T02:59:24.691Z,@farobek You can log in with any of the other options
farobek,2015-01-04T03:00:11.484Z,It doesn't work
farobek,2015-01-04T03:00:42.409Z,I made an account with FCC in December by signing up through GitHub
farobek,2015-01-04T03:02:11.290Z,since then I have been accessing my account by signing in through GitHub. That option seems to have been removed now. I have tried accessing my account through Twitter but it just creates a new account rather than accessing the existing one.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:02:16.567Z,what do you mean it doesn't work?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:02:22.104Z,oh
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:02:27.508Z,that is intersting
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:02:48.808Z,are you sure it's a new account? We did update the challenges recently and all progress was lost

heynoella,2015-01-04T03:04:09.553Z,@sircharleswatson  thank you!
heynoella,2015-01-04T03:04:18.742Z,"I found this through a link on my friend's tumblr, and I want to learn code because it seems useful"
farobek,2015-01-04T03:04:35.564Z,"Well, FCC homepage used to have 4 ways of signing up: github, twitter, facebook and google. Now it only has 3."
farobek,2015-01-04T03:05:11.068Z,For me it is a problem because I signed up using Github thus I can only access my account using Github.
farobek,2015-01-04T03:05:22.263Z,P.S. Worked out a solution
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:05:27.615Z,I understand. They are all linked. So it shouldn't matter which one you signed up with
farobek,2015-01-04T03:05:48.051Z,"Well, it seems they are not linked. At least in my case."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:06:27.972Z,@iheartkode @odrisck Have you heard anyone else having those issues ^
farobek,2015-01-04T03:06:54.086Z,My GitHub account is only linked to my hotmail account so for example signing up with my Google account would not grant me access to my account.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:07:05.202Z,gotcha
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:07:15.231Z,that makes sense then that it wouldn't work for you
iheartkode,2015-01-04T03:07:27.774Z,"The github signup was glitching, I believe it's being worked on asap."
farobek,2015-01-04T03:07:30.161Z,I noticed a pattern in the authentication urls used by FCC: http://www.freecodecamp.com/auth/[service]
farobek,2015-01-04T03:07:56.531Z,"so I just insert ""github"" in [service] and I am in!"
farobek,2015-01-04T03:08:02.259Z,*inserted
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:08:18.205Z,That shouldn't work
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:08:25.830Z,@iheartkode  that is a bug
farobek,2015-01-04T03:08:31.143Z,I was scared I had lost my progress and my forum posts! :D
seahik,2015-01-04T03:10:05.771Z,how many FCC challenges are there currently?  Is 53 correct?  
farobek,2015-01-04T03:10:09.152Z,@iheartkode Cool! @sircharleswatson Do you mean that inserting github http://www.freecodecamp.com/auth/[service] should not work? So I just found my first bug in a website! :D
farobek,2015-01-04T03:10:23.066Z,There are 54 challenges I think @seahik 
Nocando,2015-01-04T03:10:48.024Z,"I have a question about this code
$("".photo"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function(){});
when I type"". photo"" it selects the .photos class in the ul element. Then inside the event handler of .on() is it just selecting all of the li nested in the class "".photo"" ?"
farobek,2015-01-04T03:10:48.411Z,Starting from 0 :)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:10:54.247Z,@seahik 54 is correct

seahik,2015-01-04T03:12:10.815Z,I wonder if it's related to the log in problem?

iheartkode,2015-01-04T03:14:31.957Z,so what did you want to do when they enter the photo
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:14:33.435Z,"@farobek That is a good question. I assume that the majority of people use the same email for each service so it normally wouldn't be a problem. For your situation however, i'm not sure."
Nocando,2015-01-04T03:14:48.135Z,"for .on(""li"") is this written to select the li?"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:14:55.221Z,@farobek I personally would just log in with another service and mark the challenges i've already done
sircharleswatson,2015-01-04T03:15:05.320Z,@iheartkode might have a better idea
iheartkode,2015-01-04T03:15:09.445Z,You want the li to be selected or the class photo?
Nocando,2015-01-04T03:15:25.899Z,Let's add a bit more behavior to the page though. Write an event handler that watches for mouseenter on any li elements within our .photos elements and runs an empty function. We'll implement the function later on.
Nocando,2015-01-04T03:15:25.815Z,It's telling me to do this

terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:00:16.194Z,"the thing about hapi that is kind of strange is that they show Paypal uses hapi (I can understand why, I like it better than express), yet paypal released Kraken which is Express based"

Nocando,2015-01-04T04:01:34.993Z,"hmmm, thanks :D"
Nocando,2015-01-04T04:01:39.979Z,Ill just ask some other time lol

Nocando,2015-01-04T04:05:39.234Z,Question. Why does FCC introduce jQuery before the basics of JS?
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:05:47.890Z,they’re free
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:05:54.261Z,google paid for you

terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:06:44.699Z,"@Nocando because jquery is actually a really easy js framework that doesn’t really require a lot of knowledge of the intracacies of js, and reinforces the dom in your mind, which you’ve just finished brushing up on from html and css"

BenClist,2015-01-04T04:41:49.746Z,you need to put

Nocando,2015-01-04T04:44:20.911Z,"@iheartkode Thanks, didn't see that"
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:44:21.485Z,Cya
Lumiras,2015-01-04T04:44:30.797Z,"@terakilobyte the first JS stuff I learned used anonymous functions almost exclusively, it was so frustrating and I didn't understand anything by the end of it :)"
BenClist,2015-01-04T04:44:57.621Z,whats the syntax to display code properly in this chat btw? Not that familiar with git styling
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:45:06.842Z,"anonymous functions are awesome, but for this particular exercise they wouldn’t work since they want you to reference the function from the handler"
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:45:31.401Z,@Lumiras you’ll use anonymous functions a whole lot more going forward :)
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:45:44.064Z,especially when you start node
BenClist,2015-01-04T04:45:46.932Z,and because you've called 2 anon functions that are identical it's better to declare one function and then recall it
Lumiras,2015-01-04T04:45:54.020Z,@BenClist use the ` three times
BenClist,2015-01-04T04:46:06.617Z,@Lumiras thanks
Lumiras,2015-01-04T04:46:22.880Z,"like this:
```
code = codeIsFun;
```
"
Lumiras,2015-01-04T04:47:16.644Z,@BenClist no problem!
seahik,2015-01-04T04:48:28.213Z,"what suggestions are there for tackling the coderbyte challenges?  I've done about half of the easy, but struggling through alot."
odrisck,2015-01-04T04:48:51.664Z,you might try pairing with someone
odrisck,2015-01-04T04:49:10.904Z,https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/LetsPair though its an exercise in patience :)
seahik,2015-01-04T04:49:48.397Z,ah neat i didnt know there was a chat room thanks
seahik,2015-01-04T04:50:51.472Z,"but other than pairing, any suggestions out there?  ive been reading eloquentJS a little"
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:51:01.936Z,read more and practice
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:51:36.542Z,"Code a lot.
"
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:51:36.545Z,"and look at other people’s solutions and learn what you can, though realize the shortest solution isn’t necessarily the best solution"
DavidII,2015-01-04T04:51:42.742Z,I would do more reading and trial an error 
seahik,2015-01-04T04:51:45.827Z,i wonder if it helps to study completed algorightms
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:51:56.888Z,"if you study the right ones, sure"
seahik,2015-01-04T04:51:58.221Z,if there is a good resource for solved challenges
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:52:14.488Z,And read the JS style guide.
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:52:22.117Z,otherwise it can hurt if they used a really poor solution that runs in like n! or n^2 time
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T04:52:26.536Z,"@GrahamFischer wouldn't call Debian/Ubuntu (and other distributions of Linux) a 'version of linux' like Windows 7 is a 'version of Windows', it doesn't quite work like that. GNU/Linux is an operating system by itself, but it's about as much of a blank slate of an operating system as you can get. So there exist distributions of Linux. They take that blank slate and add things people will probably find useful. Each of them have different opinions about how things should be done, which software should come preinstalled, which software to make available through their official package manager on their official repository (which will involve making decisions about which type of software (eg. open source, binary blobs) they want to support). Each of these is put together by different people, so it's not like a different version of Windows, which will still be put together by Microsoft. However software is likely to work across distributions. (also a package manager is a software installation tool - a repository is a bucket/list of softwares)"
seahik,2015-01-04T04:53:06.742Z,@iheartkode do you have link for style guide by chance?
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:53:13.309Z,Yes
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:53:29.143Z,https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:53:46.830Z,The google one :)
seahik,2015-01-04T04:54:17.867Z,i think i saw on reddit a list of common interview algorithm questions with answers....but im not sure it was in javascript
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:54:40.066Z,"@seahik it’s kind of a pain in the beginning, but setting up node locally and using an editor that has linting can enforce some pretty good styling"
seahik,2015-01-04T04:54:43.343Z,@iheartkode tyty
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:55:02.331Z,np :)
seahik,2015-01-04T04:55:11.315Z,i write in codepen that uses lint i think
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:55:24.426Z,Brackets has linting for JS CSS and HTML
seahik,2015-01-04T04:55:26.527Z,i also have brackets...do people use that for JS?
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:55:32.771Z,I do.
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:55:41.097Z,as do I
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:55:48.834Z,You can install the JsHint plugin
benstoltz,2015-01-04T04:55:49.980Z,"Oh, for folks who are a bit further along with development and who are looking for a really good full featured IDE, I highly highly recommend: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ "
seahik,2015-01-04T04:56:01.452Z,ok cool i should try it more
benstoltz,2015-01-04T04:56:05.832Z,It’s pretty awesome. 
benstoltz,2015-01-04T04:56:16.777Z,(and free if you’re a student!)
iheartkode,2015-01-04T04:56:17.018Z,"Webstorm is great, but free is the only case for some."
GrahamFischer,2015-01-04T04:56:36.767Z,@pedromaltez thanks for the detailed description
benstoltz,2015-01-04T04:56:45.870Z,Also free for OS work
benstoltz,2015-01-04T04:56:51.382Z,Like what we do here...
seahik,2015-01-04T04:57:51.172Z,i should look to see what kind of tools are available through uni here in sweden
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T04:58:21.679Z,@seahik you may be able to get the student pack from github
seahik,2015-01-04T04:59:36.029Z,ah ok....(i feel lost on github)
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T05:00:07.001Z,@seahik learn to love it
seahik,2015-01-04T05:00:23.347Z,actually one question i have about github...
seahik,2015-01-04T05:00:44.585Z,if someone has a repo there....can you not always see a live demo of it?
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T05:00:59.762Z,only if they’ve set it up
terakilobyte,2015-01-04T05:01:05.795Z,and it’s public
seahik,2015-01-04T05:01:12.355Z,ah ok that makes sense
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:01:49.025Z,"@GrahamFischer in case you have any questions relating to that - or something else  - feel free to ask me, I'll try to help where I can."
seahik,2015-01-04T05:02:03.863Z,is a demo usually set up on pages.github project pages?
seahik,2015-01-04T05:02:58.279Z,or can it be demo'd some other way?  like codepen does
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:03:16.147Z,you can demo it however you like
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:03:16.825Z,pages require you to know git
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:03:33.515Z,and then link to it from your repo
seahik,2015-01-04T05:04:05.472Z,ok cool ...im sure it will make sense when get in there more
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T05:05:46.469Z,@iyeager2004 @Maximization could you quickly describe the exact bug on Dash? I’ll tweet it to the creator.
emperor-jimmu,2015-01-04T05:06:01.586Z,"Hi all, a new guy here..."
emperor-jimmu,2015-01-04T05:06:17.101Z,hello world!
BenClist,2015-01-04T05:07:24.460Z,hi @emperor-jimmu 
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:07:57.266Z,Hello @emperor-jimmu  welcome!
Nocando,2015-01-04T05:08:18.510Z,idk if I should pay to host my portfolio now or just wait.
GrahamFischer,2015-01-04T05:08:23.631Z,@pedromaltez If I have any more I'll definitely ask
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:08:25.644Z,"@seahik you can use github pages. generally you'll have a special branch that hosts just the demo page. it's called 'gh-pages'. quite often it's used as a place where some simple documentation or a  'getting started' information page is held. quick real life example: https://github.com/gcuisinier/jenv is the main repository, but has a special branch 'gh-pages' https://github.com/gcuisinier/jenv/tree/gh-pages which is hosted on github (but has it's own domain): http://www.jenv.be/
it's fairly simple to set up, and it's well documented by GitHub. This is only really relevant for static websites, however."
GrahamFischer,2015-01-04T05:08:30.519Z,thanks!
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:08:44.448Z,5.00 at digital ocean is what I use for my site.
Nocando,2015-01-04T05:10:23.534Z,@iheartkode Thanks
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:10:24.809Z,@Nocando depends what your portfolio consists of. Just static? You might be able to get away with just github pages. or AWS S3 for a bit more control and ability to enable SSL.
Nocando,2015-01-04T05:11:08.112Z,"It's static right now, I will be adding javascript soon"
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:11:09.174Z,I used github pages for a long time.. and you can point your domain to it.
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:11:23.165Z,JS is fine as long as it's on the client.
Nocando,2015-01-04T05:11:56.446Z,"I see, I'll just use github"
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:12:13.083Z,You will learn some git in the process.
Nocando,2015-01-04T05:12:26.161Z,thank you guys :D
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:12:27.693Z,@Nocando yes like @iheartkode it would still be static. dynamic would mean that it's running on server - has something being calculated and not just being just served
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:12:44.118Z,Anytime
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:12:45.915Z,I mean like @iheartkode said*
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:12:52.040Z,@iheartkode is not static
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:13:01.044Z,or an it..
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:13:04.902Z,lol
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:13:16.843Z,I changed it lol
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:13:52.917Z,btw if you hit the up arrow key you can edit your last message :)
seahik,2015-01-04T05:14:38.410Z,"@pedromaltez thanks for examples!  i did follow githubs instructions to set up a project page, but it didnt work for me.  But then i soon figured out i could preview with brackets and codepen.  So stopped trying to troubleshoot on GH pages "
Kilak1234,2015-01-04T05:14:59.978Z,I was wondering if anyone could elaborate on the differences between learning from this website and self-training myself to learn Python. Let me know please!
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:15:12.045Z,yeah I hadn't realised you could edit messages on this chatroom software - used to IRC and the like
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:15:21.794Z,thanks @iheartkode 
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:15:28.764Z,This website is focused on JavaScript.
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:16:03.234Z,But there are a lot of resources on the web for Python..
Kilak1234,2015-01-04T05:16:33.654Z,JavaScript is more front end coding to create web pages correct? While Python is a higher level program that would be more useful creating video games or controlling computers?
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:16:35.340Z,So there is no comparison.
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:16:53.869Z,"Right, also Math and Science."
Kilak1234,2015-01-04T05:16:58.911Z,Thanks!
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:16:59.951Z,also if you learn javascript you can probably teach yourself python more easily later - unless you've decided you're going to learn python and that's it.
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:17:12.827Z,"JS is also for server side, desktop and pc controllers."
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:17:14.323Z,"Python is also applicable to Web development via Django, Flask, etc"
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:17:32.130Z,Well... there are plenty of games built in JavaScript
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:17:37.251Z,And Games HTML5 :)
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:17:46.492Z,also mobile games 
Kilak1234,2015-01-04T05:17:50.760Z,"Would anybody advice against learning from a 1600 page Python book, and to just start this website?"
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:18:05.611Z,What is your goal?
seahik,2015-01-04T05:18:14.727Z,@benstoltz I hear you do GIS?  do you know and use python also?  
Kilak1234,2015-01-04T05:18:45.787Z,"I would like to one day be a software engineer, possibly at Google. Or run a business dealing with computer science and technology support"
StevenKW,2015-01-04T05:19:03.288Z,"
@Kilak1234 which book?"
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:19:09.522Z,I would always advise someone to not learn from a 1600 page book because that sounds like hell. unless you're the kind of person that enjoys 1600 page books.
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:19:18.199Z,"Python is good for that, as MIT adopted it.."
Kilak1234,2015-01-04T05:19:26.698Z,'Learning Python' by Mark Lutz - 5th edition
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:19:29.819Z,lol what pedro says
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:19:34.554Z,@seahik Affirmative on both counts. 
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:19:49.139Z,Learn Python the Hard Way is another great resource for learning Python
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:20:08.562Z,"yes @benstoltz, about to suggest LPtHW"
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:20:16.017Z,Books like that are dry and will get boring fast lol
MychaelZ,2015-01-04T05:20:25.727Z,finished rewriting javascripts native methods for arrays and strings

MychaelZ,2015-01-04T05:20:31.803Z,took me two days
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:20:37.997Z,I say learn python the hard way and code your heart out.
MychaelZ,2015-01-04T05:20:38.782Z,so happy right now :)
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:20:42.353Z,@seahik Where at?
seahik,2015-01-04T05:20:54.517Z,Lund Uni in sweden
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:21:08.006Z,Entirely unfamiliar with :P
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:21:17.576Z,What was your undergrad in?
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:21:21.680Z,python the hard way: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/
Kilak1234,2015-01-04T05:21:21.967Z,@iheartkode would you say there are advantages to learning it the hard way? Just simply problem solving and more fault that would allow more in depth learning?
seahik,2015-01-04T05:21:29.401Z,its actually a fully online course.....(I don't know how internationally reputable it is)
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:21:41.322Z,Because when you struggle you learn.
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:21:44.105Z,brb
seahik,2015-01-04T05:21:57.885Z,well Lund Uni is full on reputable...I just dont know the rep of the GIS master program
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:22:06.277Z,aye
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:22:17.324Z,"What was your undergrad degree in, if you don’t mind my asking?"
seahik,2015-01-04T05:22:27.650Z,Bio/Zoo/Ecology
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:22:41.394Z,"Oh nice, I originally went to college for Enviro scie"
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:22:55.297Z,Specifically was looking at marine science/salt marshes
seahik,2015-01-04T05:23:04.854Z,the GIS program is enviro focused
skrpt,2015-01-04T05:23:31.356Z,Which browser do you guys prefer?  FFox or Chrome?
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:23:34.958Z,"btw does gitter tell you when someone mentioned you and you missed it? so far it's only said ""# new/unread messages"" when I return to the page."
odrisck,2015-01-04T05:23:37.278Z,I use both
seahik,2015-01-04T05:23:45.022Z,i finished the intro GIS course before christmas...i really liked it
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:23:46.173Z,Safari

pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:24:28.836Z,haha exactly! :D
seahik,2015-01-04T05:24:35.120Z,ah i saw Penn's GIS MOOC
seahik,2015-01-04T05:24:54.291Z,i think
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:25:06.078Z,"They have an exceptional program, my GF is going there for her Masters/Phd"
seahik,2015-01-04T05:25:21.789Z,ah nice!
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:25:43.812Z,"One thing I’ll definitely say, getting web dev/programming experience is going to put you massssssssively ahead in the GIS field."
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:26:11.433Z,Chrome

benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:26:28.930Z,Aye
seahik,2015-01-04T05:26:40.284Z,do you use QGIS?
pedromaltez,2015-01-04T05:26:56.590Z,"actually I prefer Chrome generally, but I wish it performed like Safari. I don't know what voodoo Apple performed,, but at least on a 'retina' display it is much much smoother. However there's one incredibly frustrating bug in Chrome for OS X that has been around for too long - it handles something in Facebook wrong and pisses me off all the time by scrolling back up to the top of the page every time I exit a modal"
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:27:04.766Z,I mean more from a marketability standpoint and from an increased starting salary standpoint. Programming compentency makes you significantly more valuable
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:27:30.039Z,"I mainly use an ESRI stack, though I’ve used QGIS and GRASS before, Leaflet, Mapbox, etc"
seahik,2015-01-04T05:27:34.103Z,my partner is a GIS professional...i keep trying to get him to play around with the python codeacadmey course
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:28:08.826Z,What type of GIS does he do?
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:28:15.198Z,Python is the language for science.
iheartkode,2015-01-04T05:28:32.721Z,"Nasa uses it :)

seahik,2015-01-04T05:29:21.275Z,utilities
benstoltz,2015-01-04T05:29:22.588Z,Python scripting becomes incredibly useful when working in a GIS environment. Highly highly highly recommend it.

BeaCodes,2015-01-04T05:58:26.203Z,"Thanks guys :) @StevenKW  a ctf is a capture the flag competition where your team tries to hack the other team while trying to protect your own network. involves lots of cryptography, binary analysis, etc."
StevenKW,2015-01-04T06:00:16.598Z,@BeaCodes That sounds like a lot of fun.
BeaCodes,2015-01-04T06:01:12.496Z,right?! I'm excited to start learning crypto 
seahik,2015-01-04T06:03:15.077Z,wow fun and sounds like great experience.  i'm super paranoid about security...would be nice to know more about it before building sites

QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T06:16:05.369Z,@KyleRConway Welcome to our community
seahik,2015-01-04T06:17:04.217Z,@QuincyLarson thanks!  i'm googling also...good 'ol stack overflow to the rescue
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T06:17:34.393Z,"@seahik I’m not sure exactly why, but having the * after \d seems to be triggering the false (empty) matches. If you remove it, you’ll get an array of numbers you can parse as integers"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T06:18:36.671Z,"@towwiow @StevenKW CTF stands for Capture the Flag. It’s a security exercise (basically, you hack a target for academic exercise). Stripe had a pretty successful CTF event last year."
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T06:19:24.954Z,"@pedromaltez Yes, you should receive an email notification."
seahik,2015-01-04T06:20:39.195Z,ah i think I figured it out....i needed to use /d+ instead of /d*

apexpred,2015-01-04T07:36:35.231Z,how important is a consistent sleep schedule?
Nocando,2015-01-04T07:39:00.220Z,I'm currently reading your blog post. @QuincyLarson 
mjcCodes,2015-01-04T07:39:14.125Z,"@apexpred Gosh, if it's super important I'm in trouble. I sleep when my body wants, regardless of what the timeclock says. Been doing so for over 1.5 years. I cured the HORRIBLE insomnia I suffered from for over 4 years."
Nocando,2015-01-04T07:39:25.285Z,@apexpred it helps your body adapt to whatever sleep schedule you want. You have to plan it out
Nocando,2015-01-04T07:39:54.666Z,I also use SleepCycle app. Best app I've ever purchased.
mjcCodes,2015-01-04T07:41:05.424Z,"For me, trying to fit my sleep into an artificial schedule just didn't work. "
Nocando,2015-01-04T07:42:05.325Z,@mjcCodes I looked into polyphasic sleep to maximize my productivity throughout the day.
apexpred,2015-01-04T07:42:12.904Z,well I guess my sleep schedule is consistent. I just don't sleep at night
mjcCodes,2015-01-04T07:45:33.685Z,"@apexpred mine is consistently 8-9 hours but it cycles. Sometimes I'm awake during daytime, other times I'm awake all night. "
mjcCodes,2015-01-04T07:46:02.131Z,"Believe you me, it's better than not being able to sleep for 3 days straight."
mjcCodes,2015-01-04T07:46:28.360Z,@Nocando What is polyphasic sleep?
mjcCodes,2015-01-04T07:56:50.940Z,@M-Vais Howdy!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T07:56:56.366Z,@M-Vais Welcome to our community
M-Vais,2015-01-04T07:57:06.619Z,Thanks!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T07:57:56.637Z,"@apexpred I think a consistent sleep schedule is important, but more important is sufficient sleep - 7 - 8 hours per night, not too much more or too much less"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T07:58:53.572Z,"@Nocando I would recommend against trying polyphasic sleep. I’ve heard horror stories about it, and I don’t think the productivity gain is worth the trade off (a fragile cycle of naps)"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T08:01:27.830Z,"The US military has definitely experimented with this a lot and here are their recommendations: Each individual nap should be long enough to provide at least 45 continuous minutes of sleep, although longer naps (2 hours) are better. In general, the shorter each individual nap is, the more frequent the naps should be (the objective remains to acquire a daily total of 8 hours of sleep)."
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T08:02:05.408Z,They don’t seem to think you can sustainably sleep less with polyphasic sleep - just in shorter bursts. Which negates a lot of the upside imho

kiytang,2015-01-04T09:51:05.044Z,@QuincyLarson good night
kiytang,2015-01-04T09:53:07.577Z,@RussEby thank you very much! I was confused with why 'text-align' could only be applied to blocks and not spans-  
Nocando,2015-01-04T09:58:32.767Z,"Can someone explain to me what this does?
```
event.stopPropagation
```"
RussEby,2015-01-04T09:59:21.891Z,When an event happens such as a user clicks on an element; every element above it will also get the click. This stops that from happening.

serhiicss,2015-01-04T10:08:16.277Z,Is it ok if I use bootsrap?
teddy-error,2015-01-04T10:16:25.775Z,"I think bootstrap comes into play in one of the lessons @serhiicss so, sure. why not?"
RussEby,2015-01-04T10:16:44.141Z,I don't see why not. Bootstrap adds a lot to the page with little work from you. There are a lot of themes out there that can add a lot of color to your page.
serhiicss,2015-01-04T10:21:50.099Z,Ok. Thank you. I will try building my website with bootsrap.
Nocando,2015-01-04T10:26:58.250Z,"@RussEby Sorry, i forgot to reply. Thanks it sorta helped me understand it a bit more"
RussEby,2015-01-04T10:33:10.812Z,@Nocando No prob. I didn't get bubbling until I was working with an event and didn't put that in. You'll get multiple click events with just one click!

farobek,2015-01-04T12:38:52.703Z,@Kilak1234 The book is more of a reference than an actual book you can learn from. LPtHM is a better alternative imo

mxys,2015-01-04T16:40:29.940Z,There need to be more cute and entertaining ways to learn programming (re: js for cats). A lot of textbooks I've used are so dry - I can see why a lot of beginners would get scared off.

Alexandre937,2015-01-04T17:01:28.033Z,Can be really dumb question but can we use relative url with background image ?

Alexandre937,2015-01-04T17:02:43.673Z,"background: url(""/assets/anna-bg.png"");
instead of:
background: url(""http://dash.ga.co/assets/anna-bg.png"");

but it doesnt seem to work... is it only because of the tutorial website?"
benstoltz,2015-01-04T17:03:04.865Z,It’s because it’s a tutorial website.
Alexandre937,2015-01-04T17:03:48.953Z,"So if our website is made correctly, we would be able to include the image normally without everything right?
"
benstoltz,2015-01-04T17:04:07.952Z,"Correct, you would supply a relative path to the image."
Alexandre937,2015-01-04T17:04:35.771Z,"Ok, thx"
benstoltz,2015-01-04T17:06:26.613Z,"Keep in mind on a normal production site you’ll be using a separate CSS file so the relative path will be from THAT css file. Often CSS and JS files will be in a static folder, and then within their own css and js folders. So you’d have to have a relative path from however you structure up your project."
benstoltz,2015-01-04T17:06:30.142Z,Just something to remember
JimmyRay1,2015-01-04T17:32:44.763Z,"Hey FCCers!  I started reading (and applying) the book ""Mini Habits:  Smaller Habits, Bigger Results"" to help me work through the FCC curriculum while taking care of a pretty busy life (like most everyone else on here, lol).

QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T18:19:42.290Z,@StevenKW I listen to audio books while I run and read off an iPad when I travel or my phone when I commute. I don’t have a regular routine around this. If a book is exciting I may get through it in a few days. Some really heavy books take me months (In which case I read other books in parallel). How about you? How do you read?
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T18:20:56.816Z,@serhiicss Thanks! Do you guys think this is ready to tweet out or did you see any edits/suggestions? I’m always afraid I go too into depth on things and it becomes boring.
StevenKW,2015-01-04T18:24:19.982Z,"@QuincyLarson I really like audio books I am surprised how comparable the experience to reading is  without all the looking at the page and page turning. I also have a Kindle that is great to read on. The good thing about the Kindle is if you fall asleep reading you don't lose your place.
All that said I wish I found more time for reading. I tend to go in cycles where I read a lot and then times when I don't read at all.
The public library is an excellent resource for ebooks and audiobooks for FREE!"

JimmyRay1,2015-01-04T18:33:04.631Z,"@QuincyLarson  It's a great blog post and it just goes to show what someone is capable of when they get focused, develop consistently good habits that take regular steps to achieve their goals.  I'm having a similar experience (just beginning) with the coding, contemplative ""meditation"", and practicing tai chi (for health and physical wellbeing).  

I'd say tweet away!"

trisell,2015-01-04T18:38:50.518Z,So is Google trying to push dev tools as a full fledged IDE? Or just a useful way to make quick changes to a site/debugging?

odrisck,2015-01-04T18:57:00.034Z,"I think it does, take a look at MSNBC they have an analyst that talks about that, so maybe you can find out where they get the data from there"
benstoltz,2015-01-04T18:57:41.330Z,Very nice @QuincyLarson. It looks like he’s using OpenSecrets.org for the data. I’ll have to look at their api. I’m personally planning on using data from the Sunlight Foundation.
apexpred,2015-01-04T18:58:01.595Z,I'm finally fully awake. Hello FCC 
odrisck,2015-01-04T18:58:54.949Z,hello there @apexpred

benstoltz,2015-01-04T19:02:13.570Z,Tis never too early for seafood!
DavidII,2015-01-04T19:03:02.359Z,Sushi can always be an option for me every day 
DavidII,2015-01-04T19:03:15.440Z,I at lease have it once a week
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:03:36.987Z,Never liked seafood. It's a curse
odrisck,2015-01-04T19:03:42.122Z,there is a place in the city you can take sushi making classes
DavidII,2015-01-04T19:04:14.135Z,if only it was here in Connecticut and also near me
odrisck,2015-01-04T19:04:27.352Z,well LA is only a 6 hour flight away :)

DavidII,2015-01-04T19:04:35.267Z,"@apexpred lol, not to worry I know a lot people like that. "
odrisck,2015-01-04T19:04:46.063Z,there you go :)

towwiow,2015-01-04T19:16:06.903Z,hello @AmmarAliShah 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:16:53.219Z,I've used up all my internet data
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:17:01.942Z,Tethering from my mobile now
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:18:50.213Z,Testing the gitter iOS app. Not bad
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:19:32.153Z,@apexpred I'm waiting for the android one
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:21:46.294Z,I have until summer to do something with web dev or I'm forced into finishing college
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:22:19.141Z,@apexpred forced?
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:22:41.332Z,Lol maybe too strong of a word
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:23:09.957Z,forced by will or family?
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:23:25.943Z,more my parents don't believe in this not going to college thing
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:23:55.944Z,So what are you studying right nw?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:23:59.443Z,now*
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:24:48.843Z,i was majoring in computer science but decided to take a break after 2 years to learn web development
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:25:38.167Z,BS in Computer Science?
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:26:01.877Z,Yea
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:26:23.782Z,How are logic gates treating you?
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:29:27.007Z,well the basics were kind of easy to follow but didn't get that far into it
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:29:58.366Z,ill brb in a few mins
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:32:32.764Z,okay
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T19:40:31.173Z,@apexred How close are you to finishing college?
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:41:23.611Z,50 credits or so
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:42:31.073Z,I mean I will finish it. it would be a waste if I didn't
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:42:54.225Z,Just want to learn web development right now full time
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T19:43:39.824Z,"@apexpred A degree is still really important (probably for the next 10 years or so) but you’re right - once you’ve gotten a job, the degree sort of ceases to matter until it’s time to get another job"
apexpred,2015-01-04T19:45:19.393Z,@QuincyLarson Yea I think I'm doing the right thing. College will always be there
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T19:45:23.662Z,"I have an MBA, and it helped me get a good job, but the knowledge wasn’t all that applicable to the job itself and much of it has atrophied. I’d say I may have gotten my ~$40k investment and 2 years back, but I wouldn’t recommend grad school to anyone unless they are PhD bound and love research. But undergrad degrees are always a good bet."
benstoltz,2015-01-04T19:46:08.128Z,It also depends on the field you are going into. Sometimes the masters is more applicable to a particular field then another
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T19:47:07.070Z,I've always wondered whether grad school for computer science is worth it.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:47:49.488Z,I'm gonna go for a BE in Software Engineering
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T19:48:41.364Z,"I've got about 2 more years for BS in computer engineering. Hardest part isn't the education, it is paying for it. "
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T19:50:49.198Z,I apply in 2017 or 2018!
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T19:52:29.840Z,"Oh man, I wonder how many things will change by then"
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T19:52:41.228Z,where are you applying to?
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T19:53:41.620Z,"Degree is still worth a lot I think because, it's still very difficult to get a job otherwise."
Maximization,2015-01-04T19:54:33.600Z,@QuincyLarson what's your academic background?
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T19:54:38.162Z,I also find it teaches a person how to learn if a person does not have that ability in the first place.
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T19:57:16.622Z,@Maximization I have an undergrad degree in Liberal Arts from a state university. I did an MBA in China and spent most of my time during college focused on Asian languages. I did do one year of CS before switching to liberal arts (right when the dotcom bubble burst - wish I’d stuck with it!)
QuincyLarson,2015-01-04T19:57:25.419Z,@Maximization How about you?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-04T20:00:27.724Z,@bboyjacks it all depends on my A' Level grades

bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:12:06.645Z,"I'm transferring out of community college here in California US, and going to go to a University of Santa Barbara soon to finish the last 2 years of my education"
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:12:28.478Z,We have the option to take our first two years of college in community college here in US
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:12:38.757Z,To save some money
Maximization,2015-01-04T20:12:51.333Z,"ah I see, that's before deciding on a major right?"
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:13:09.012Z,No we declare a major from the start
Nocando,2015-01-04T20:13:37.691Z,Transferring to Berkely or San Fran 
apexpred,2015-01-04T20:13:45.554Z,yea but the first two years is a lot of general education classes
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:13:48.110Z,I've already declared mine as a Computer Engineer but found that I like software more than hardware but I'm too far in so I can't go back now
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:14:48.620Z,"Berkeley or San Fran would be great, Silicon Valley is the place to go for techies"
apexpred,2015-01-04T20:15:19.857Z,Would love to go to school in cali but out state tuition is too much
Maximization,2015-01-04T20:15:22.461Z,"@bboyjacks at least you're not too far off, imagine declaring a philosophy major first and then find out your passion is coding"
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:15:28.647Z,They have hackathons often and its a great place to learn and code with other like minded people
Nocando,2015-01-04T20:15:39.235Z,It is too much. It sucks
Nocando,2015-01-04T20:15:49.120Z,That's too far xD
Maximization,2015-01-04T20:15:58.909Z,"aww man, I'm jealous with all the hackathons, meetups you guys have over there"
apexpred,2015-01-04T20:16:25.923Z,My goal this year is to move out to cali
Nocando,2015-01-04T20:16:29.831Z,I actually don't know what's a hackathon 
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:17:18.083Z,"Hackathon is where people gather and code anything they want basically, and in the end they present their invention no matter how ridiculous it is."
benstoltz,2015-01-04T20:17:23.563Z,FYI if there is anyone interested in banking or .net Charlotte is an amazing city for getting into web dev.
benstoltz,2015-01-04T20:17:33.007Z,(just in terms of job conversations)
bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:17:36.681Z,Its usually a three day event over the weekends
Nocando,2015-01-04T20:17:40.631Z,Sounds fun!

bboyjacks,2015-01-04T20:19:14.677Z,Yea I'm 4-5 hours away from San Fran so all I can do is read about from here but I'm like a sad child just watching from the corner not able to participate

apexpred,2015-01-04T20:57:17.147Z,yea you should use addClass. css function adds it inline
farobek,2015-01-04T20:57:26.697Z,What are you +54 level users doing?
Nocando,2015-01-04T20:57:28.802Z,i see ;o

Nocando,2015-01-04T20:58:17.551Z,for jq xD
trisell,2015-01-04T20:58:18.356Z,"```

This should be valid as well."
Nocando,2015-01-04T20:58:45.606Z,I see. That looks a lot better @iheartkode 
iheartkode,2015-01-04T20:58:47.324Z,Ahh which tutorial?
Nocando,2015-01-04T20:58:57.285Z,5.3 in jQuery
apexpred,2015-01-04T20:59:08.038Z,yea its valid to pass in a object literal

iheartkode,2015-01-04T21:00:15.716Z,http://api.jquery.com/   usually will have examples and will show proper syntax
iheartkode,2015-01-04T21:00:52.890Z,It's not that it's not allowed it's just a best practice :)
Nocando,2015-01-04T21:01:09.593Z,Mhm
iheartkode,2015-01-04T21:01:10.802Z,Keep design out of program logic.
Nocando,2015-01-04T21:02:07.880Z,"How do I write 
```"
Nocando,2015-01-04T21:02:10.479Z,oops
StevenKW,2015-01-04T21:02:52.755Z,As a function of user interaction JS can modify CSS.
Nocando,2015-01-04T21:03:08.186Z,"How do i write
```
$(this).css(""background-color"", ""#252b30"");
$(this).css(""fontWeight"",""bold"");
```
without having to repeat myself?"
benstoltz,2015-01-04T21:03:27.638Z,you can abstract that css out into a class and then add the class.

trisell,2015-01-04T21:06:54.250Z,Yup. You can pass as many css parameters as you like in the array form above. But after 1 or two I personally think it makes more sense to just create a css class and then add and remove it as needed.

piecedigital,2015-01-04T21:08:54.785Z,I prefer using the braces and the colon. It just makes more sense to me in a CSS sense
iheartkode,2015-01-04T21:08:58.811Z,Yes
iheartkode,2015-01-04T21:09:12.313Z,better to do addClass(); in that case.
Rybar,2015-01-04T21:29:24.569Z,"@piecedigital what David and Mark are getting at is that it's better to keep styling separate from code whenever possible. 1, in keeping with the MVC mindset, and 2, it's cleaner and easier to change a stylesheet once than all the places you might have made that css change in your javsascript.

benstoltz,2015-01-04T23:31:19.275Z,"NP, keep in mind querySelectorAll(selector) works differently on browsers before IE9"
jmcshane,2015-01-04T23:31:23.375Z,there's a good stack overflow about this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11503534/jquery-vs-document-queryselectorall
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-04T23:31:27.718Z,Right @apexpred I was wondering if that particular object just used the same native method.
apexpred,2015-01-04T23:32:31.079Z,you would have to look at the source code to be sure
Alexurban,2015-01-04T23:33:14.781Z,hello world
benstoltz,2015-01-04T23:33:33.327Z,Welcome @Alexurban!
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-04T23:33:33.586Z,@jmcshane Good link. Thanks.
apexpred,2015-01-04T23:33:57.043Z,hello @Alexurban 
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-04T23:33:59.901Z,Welcome @Alexurban 
Technicoder,2015-01-04T23:34:20.702Z,Hello #FreeCodeCamp kids!  I just signed up now and am beginning my challenges.  Free camp!  :) 
claytonchatham,2015-01-04T23:34:21.309Z,Good morning.
piecedigital,2015-01-04T23:34:43.065Z,"@Alexurban Greetings and welcome to FCC!
@claytonchatham G'morning!"
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-04T23:34:47.481Z,Hey @Technicoder . Welcome~
Technicoder,2015-01-04T23:35:26.045Z,Thank You @AnthonyIsaacs !  Which challenge are you currently working on?
jmcshane,2015-01-04T23:35:27.101Z,Nice to see so many people joining today like me! Hello @Technicoder @Alexurban 
Technicoder,2015-01-04T23:35:58.734Z,"Oh, another newb!  @jmcshane @Alexurban "
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-04T23:36:17.498Z,"@Technicoder jQuery exercises. #16, I think. Good stuff."
Technicoder,2015-01-04T23:39:14.915Z,"Nice!  @AnthonyIsaacs  I am currently taking an online course through Stanford U  as well, Computer Science 101.  It's the basics and has been really helpful as a nice intro.  Here is link for any other newbies: https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CS101/Summer2014/about"
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-04T23:42:34.777Z,FCC will have you complete some of the Stanford material as well. You should check challenges #18-23 for overlap if you're interested.
Technicoder,2015-01-04T23:47:36.205Z,"Oh, nice!  Thanks for the info, I'll have a look at those challenges @AnthonyIsaacs "
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-04T23:49:36.087Z,@Technicoder No problem. This community is great about helping out and sharing knowledge and resources. Just ask!
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-04T23:50:02.885Z,Gotta run for now.
Technicoder,2015-01-04T23:54:25.521Z,Ciao
Technicoder,2015-01-04T23:55:53.950Z,Hello @jmcshane !  How did you find out about the FreeCodeCamp?  I learned about it thru Twitter and it looks to be such an awesome help.  
jmcshane,2015-01-04T23:57:16.527Z,"@Technicoder There was a post on /r/Linux recently, which is a forum I have been following for some time.  I've been interested in learning JavaScript more formally and I think this is the best mechanism I have found for doing so."
Technicoder,2015-01-05T00:00:56.271Z,Very good.  Do you currently work in a programming environment and just want to learn more? @jmcshane 
jmcshane,2015-01-05T00:01:35.266Z,"@Technicoder yes, i work at a large company doing mostly Java.  I am hoping to use JS to be able to move toward a software engineer position"
420kush420,2015-01-05T00:02:35.973Z,Good evening guys & gals
dflan,2015-01-05T00:05:16.045Z,"Hi, I came across a minor issue with part 3 of build a robot, "" instead of ' on slide 31"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T00:05:42.069Z,@420kush420 Welcome back!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T00:05:55.077Z,@dflan It’s a known issue in Dash
dflan,2015-01-05T00:06:25.743Z,Cheers Quincy
apexpred,2015-01-05T00:07:21.075Z,@QuincyLarson does it matter where you buy a domain name?
dflan,2015-01-05T00:08:14.418Z,@apexpred not godaddy! :)
Technicoder,2015-01-05T00:08:42.237Z,I was curious about what hosting site to use as well.
benstoltz,2015-01-05T00:21:53.147Z,@Technicoder I use Dreamhost and Digital Ocean.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T00:22:55.260Z,Namecheap is one of the best for getting domains
mikeelliott,2015-01-05T00:23:53.769Z,I've been very happy with mediatemple.net hosting for the past few years but they did just get acquired by godaddy
benstoltz,2015-01-05T00:24:11.495Z,ick godaddy
apexpred,2015-01-05T00:24:15.481Z,K ill try namecheap thanks @sircharleswatson 
dflan,2015-01-05T00:25:01.602Z,+1 for namecheap
Technicoder,2015-01-05T00:26:11.268Z,"There seems to be lots of dislike for godaddy.  :)  We use this for work emails.  I will have a look at Dreamhost and Digital Ocean, thanks @benstoltz !  And, I'll also check out Namecheap, thanks @sircharleswatson .  There seem to be so many, it's difficult to narrow it down.  "
benstoltz,2015-01-05T00:27:51.471Z,"@Technicoder Digital Ocean is great if you want a VPS for cheap, they start at $5 a month for pretty good quality. It’s all bare bones though so all the setup is on you"
grafol,2015-01-05T00:28:04.512Z,Are the forums being really slow for anyone else?
benstoltz,2015-01-05T00:28:26.616Z,slower then usual or just in general? :p
jmcshane,2015-01-05T00:29:13.327Z,"@grafol I've had the same issue.  just started this morning, so I don't know if it is just today"
benstoltz,2015-01-05T00:29:25.252Z,it’s usually pretty slow
dflan,2015-01-05T00:29:46.126Z,The main problem I have with godaddy is it treats everyone like it's their second day on the internet.
grafol,2015-01-05T00:30:30.922Z,"Ha, well as long as I'm not the only one ""suffering"""
apexpred,2015-01-05T00:37:45.936Z,the forums seem fine to me
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T00:43:26.352Z,"The reason the forum is slow is it’s a rails app, not a node app"
jsonify,2015-01-05T00:43:48.678Z,anyone up to help out on a special project real quick? 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T00:43:54.497Z,It’s powered by Discourse. I gave it a dedicated Small AWS instance so it should be relatively fast
skrpt,2015-01-05T00:44:34.401Z,@QuincyLarson what's the first language you learned?
420kush420,2015-01-05T00:49:29.997Z,"I'm going to continue with my challenged tonight, might have a huge chunk done. not sure. "
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T00:56:19.832Z,@codeshi Python. You can read all about how I learned here: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html
skrpt,2015-01-05T01:03:15.243Z,"@QuincyLarson That was a great read!  I can absolutely relate, jumping from Ruby/RoR to Python and then JS.  I've also wasted several thousands of $$$ on Online and Offline ""coding bootcamps.""  Losing focus is very easy.  My goal now is to stick with JS and start from scratch with a new outlook, and get ready for Hack Reactor next year."
cerissa,2015-01-05T01:03:21.564Z,"@QuincyLarson  ive dabbled in python, it was what got me interested in learning programming then later on i wanted to learn web design. i still have a strong desire to learn python"
BenClist,2015-01-05T01:07:24.334Z,Anyone know how I can login to my account now that the github option is gone??
skrpt,2015-01-05T01:08:56.988Z,Are you sure it's gone?  I just used it to log in earlier.
BenClist,2015-01-05T01:09:27.669Z,"google, facebook, linkedin, twitter and email are the only options I see"
BenClist,2015-01-05T01:09:55.804Z,"ah don't worry I did link it to Twitter, didn't think I had"
BenClist,2015-01-05T01:10:10.171Z,bit screwed for people who haven't though

benstoltz,2015-01-05T01:12:45.665Z,Hey….does anyone fly a lot? So I had this website that I found that would break a trip down to it’s cheapest possible components. Unfortunately I didn’t save the url….
benstoltz,2015-01-05T01:13:44.878Z,Wasn’t any of the big travel sites...

QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T01:25:37.332Z,@Phonbopit Thanks for letting me know.
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T01:26:09.445Z,"@BenClist Github auth is really messed up right now, so we pulled it."
dflan,2015-01-05T01:26:11.849Z,level 1 number 10
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T01:26:30.100Z,@BenClist Sorry for the inconvenience
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T01:27:01.492Z,@cerissa I would say Python is worth learning if you want to program for research or statistics. It isn’t the best tool for web development.
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T01:27:25.151Z,@dflan Which specific Free Code Camp challenge?
benstoltz,2015-01-05T01:27:31.977Z,(I mildly disagree with that statement re web development) @QuincyLarson 
dflan,2015-01-05T01:27:39.498Z,Challenge 10
dflan,2015-01-05T01:28:11.612Z,http://try.jquery.com/levels/1/challenges/10
benstoltz,2015-01-05T01:28:19.279Z,"It’s certainly not as big as say, Ruby, but it’s a segment of the industry that definitely exists. And there is definitely more need then there are developers to fill it."
benstoltz,2015-01-05T01:30:22.661Z,Granted the fields that use it the most are scientific/research/data science oriented.
benstoltz,2015-01-05T01:30:37.318Z,(and GIS!!! :P )
edimaudo,2015-01-05T01:32:01.372Z,Started freecodecamp today.  Anyone in Toronto?
jmcshane,2015-01-05T01:32:02.926Z, @dflan just open the sidebar and click on the next challenge.  There's an error in that specific challenge.
jmcshane,2015-01-05T01:32:39.733Z,Ive been able to get through the rest of the challenge material without issue
dflan,2015-01-05T01:32:53.218Z,Thanks @jmcshane 
dflan,2015-01-05T01:35:14.264Z,It would be handy if the known bugs could be added to the codecamp challenges...........
dflan,2015-01-05T01:35:42.499Z,or a thread in the forum?

QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T01:37:15.090Z,@edimaudo Welcome to our community!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T01:39:22.561Z,@dflan I got it to work. Here’s how: 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T01:39:31.045Z,"```javascript
$(document).ready(function( ) {
  $(""button"").on(""click"", function(){
    var message = $(""<span>Call 1-555-jquery-air to book this tour</span>"");
    $("".usa"").append(message);
    $(""button"").remove();
  });
});
```"
dflan,2015-01-05T01:41:32.549Z,"I think there might have been a mix up on the challenges, the only task was add <script src=""application.js""></script>"
BenClist,2015-01-05T01:45:49.721Z,"I had the same bug, it always tells you you haven't cleared the script tag when you have"

john8801,2015-01-05T02:14:06.360Z,What is an endpoint?
benstoltz,2015-01-05T02:15:33.389Z,http://hackingui.com/front-end/chrome-box-shadow-bug-that-crashed-our-site/ 
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T02:17:52.155Z,@john8801 in what context?
john8801,2015-01-05T02:39:06.953Z,Express.js
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T02:40:59.800Z,@john8801 it’s the ending of a route
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T02:41:13.802Z,like ‘/‘ or ‘/home’ or ‘/settings'
john8801,2015-01-05T02:41:37.874Z,so the path>
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T02:41:51.959Z,in a general sense
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T02:42:06.678Z,but it’s called an endpoint because you can do any number of things while it’s making its way there
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T02:42:14.208Z,middleware
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T02:44:20.829Z,"with express it’s really better to think of it as the terminator of a route, and a route is defined by what path it intercepts"
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T02:44:36.586Z,just my opinion though
RandyDavis,2015-01-05T02:44:51.833Z,Hello Everyone!  Came across FreeCodeCamp and definitely wanted to check it out!  I'm looking to just build more projects and get more stuff done and this looks like an awesome community to do so and learn at the same time.

RandyDavis,2015-01-05T02:52:27.440Z,@ahead123 correct!  i went to the one in austin

RandyDavis,2015-01-05T02:54:05.628Z,well i'm going to jump in and try to fly through the lessons because i want to shore up some js stuff and get going with more angular js!
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T02:54:30.978Z,@ahead123 a few people have I've heard
apexpred,2015-01-05T02:54:40.963Z,currently on challenge 15
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T02:55:47.769Z,@apexpred codeschool's jQuery is hard vs codecademy
CadaverLab,2015-01-05T02:56:22.530Z,"i did the codecademy stuff, i'm hoping this will be more thorough"
apexpred,2015-01-05T02:57:01.816Z,I've used jquery before so wasn't hard for me
CadaverLab,2015-01-05T02:58:22.714Z,"also there seems to be more to codecademy than what is linked on their frontpage. i was gonna get into their angular stuff, but it took a backseat to finals and other stuff"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T02:59:33.145Z,@RandyDavis I like your attitude!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T03:00:28.691Z,"@ahead123 Yes, several people have finished all the FCC challenges and have also finished all the easy and medium Coderbyte challenges: http://www.freecodecamp.com/stats"

apexpred,2015-01-05T03:09:00.049Z,on challenge #15 exercise #9 isn't the solution it shows wrong?
jmcshane,2015-01-05T03:10:11.441Z,@apexpred what's your issue with the solution.  i just worked on that exercise a few minutes ago
jmcshane,2015-01-05T03:11:40.754Z,http://stackoverflow.com/questions/499405/change-the-selected-value-of-a-drop-down-list-with-jquery
john8801,2015-01-05T03:11:46.184Z,Do I need to know AJAX to do the Express.js course? It seems to expect that as a prerequisite.
apexpred,2015-01-05T03:14:33.159Z,"Yea I see, just seemed weird that jquery returned the whole select field instead of just the option"
apexpred,2015-01-05T03:14:48.615Z,in the console
jmcshane,2015-01-05T03:16:22.162Z,"i understand that.  i think it happens that way because the ""selected"" field is the value that you see within the <select> element, so to set a specific one as the main value is to change the whole <select>"
apexpred,2015-01-05T03:17:10.763Z,yea that makes sense
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T03:29:34.086Z,on from laptop now

AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-05T03:58:59.267Z,"Hey all. Anyone know if I can always leave off the bling on the .appendTo selector in the following code: 
```
$("".target:nth-child(2)"").clone().appendTo(""#location2"");
```
It works correctly in the jQuery exercises, but the solution includes bling on the location2 selector."
apexpred,2015-01-05T04:00:17.117Z,there are more than one way to do it. If your solution works its fine
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-05T04:01:14.982Z,Thanks
ahead123,2015-01-05T04:21:48.614Z,"http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/ looks like one example of using bling on appendTo is something like $( ""h2"" ).appendTo( $( "".container"" ) ); The jquery documentation says doing it this way will  actually move the element around the DOM, instead of cloning it like in your example."
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T04:35:40.440Z,@ahead123 I agree! We’ll continue to expand the factors we track here. We believe in transparency. Nothing motivates me like seeing people around me working hard :)

I'm totally onboard with the JS movement."
MychaelZ,2015-01-05T04:52:08.219Z,ugh functional programming in javascript is making my brain hurt
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T04:52:37.765Z,Having one language across your entire project is so utterly nice. 
apexpred,2015-01-05T04:53:04.655Z,yea can't wait to learn angular and node
rcidaleassumpo,2015-01-05T04:54:18.143Z,thank you mxys!
mxys,2015-01-05T04:56:28.453Z,@iyeager2004 Here's a link to get your first month of codeschool for $9 http://tinyurl.com/qylsfbx
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T04:56:59.369Z,"@mxys Awesome, thanks."
odrisck,2015-01-05T04:57:26.925Z,welcome to our community @rcidaleassumpo 
odrisck,2015-01-05T04:58:05.147Z,@mxys I believe a few of our campers have done boots
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T04:58:39.550Z,"I've had two close friends do boot camps, one just finished Hackerspace and another is in App Academy."
mxys,2015-01-05T05:00:16.850Z,@odrisck @iyeager2004 I'm considering in enrolling in one in a few months but I always hear mixed opinions on their value.
MychaelZ,2015-01-05T05:02:15.954Z,which one?
apexpred,2015-01-05T05:02:42.512Z,you guys think I should buy .com or .me domain for my personal site?
mxys,2015-01-05T05:02:53.343Z,I was looking at the javascript/ruby program at Epicodus
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:02:53.544Z,"I don't actually have an opinion, I think they are of more value than college alone"
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:03:06.426Z,I think either is good @apexpred 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T05:03:31.277Z,@mxys welcome back!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T05:03:54.413Z,@mxys I have a friend who went to Epicodus. 
bamahonky,2015-01-05T05:04:00.242Z,I just signed up with Free Code Camp.  Just trying this out.
mxys,2015-01-05T05:04:03.211Z,"@apexpred For a personal site, both are absolutely fine. But for businesses, clients tend to like seeing .com more"
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:04:28.019Z,@bamahonky welcome to FCC
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T05:04:37.092Z,@bamahonky Welcome!
mxys,2015-01-05T05:04:55.293Z,@QuincyLarson Oh cool. Did he seem to have a good experience there? I'm considering applying soon.
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T05:05:29.307Z,"@apexpred If you can find a .com, I’d recommend that. People tend to assume it’s a .com, so getting a non .com will make it harder for people to find your site. Also, a .com gives you a Page Rank bonus"
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:05:47.662Z,@mxys I think that Hackerspace was valuable for the friend that did it. She learned alot and has turned around and gotten a job quickly from it. She was working on school work ~90-100 hours a week. 
apexpred,2015-01-05T05:06:12.261Z,thanks for the feedback guys!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T05:06:12.472Z,"@mxys He seemed to have a good time, but I found his skills to be significantly less impressive than those of my friends who went to App Academy or Hack Reactor. "
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T05:06:59.915Z,"@mxys That may be because Epicodus is less selective to begin with. That said, if I were going to go to a bootcamp, I’d want to go to the best bootcamp I could gain admission to, and that would be App Academy or Hack Reactor. "
mxys,2015-01-05T05:07:36.271Z,"@QuincyLarson Okay, that's good to know. Epicodus seems to get pretty good reviews but I think the price doesn't hurt. It's only a bit over $3000 for 4 months at Epicodus vs. $6000+ at some of these other bootcamps"
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:08:08.122Z,"@mxys App Academy is tough. He's working between 100 and 120 hours a week. Yeah, like 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. They have weekly assesments, fail two and you're out. It's 5 grand down, plus 18,000 grand of your precious wages after getting hired on afterwards. You're also learning Ruby, so there's that."
mxys,2015-01-05T05:08:17.705Z,"But if money isn't an issue, better to go for quality."
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:08:35.439Z,"That should be 8 grand, not 18. Sorry."
mxys,2015-01-05T05:09:07.157Z,"Okay, I'll have to look into App Academy too."
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:09:32.506Z,"Plus my friend in App Academy might end up flunking out, and he's a pretty sharp guy too. He said it's lots of super sharp and young CS grad types."
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:10:17.887Z,@QuincyLarson So what happens when I click that button on the bottom of the FCC challenge page that says I'm done? Fireworks?
mxys,2015-01-05T05:10:21.545Z,@iyeager2004 That's a little intimidating. I don't have much of a CS background apart from a couple JavaScript courses in HS/college.
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:12:25.962Z,"It's also tougher to get in. On the flip side, they make their money only once you get a job (i.e. it's free if you never get employed in a coding position related to the curriculum) so it's pretty much garunteed you'll get a job."
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:13:09.645Z,"@mxys Don't want to intimidate you. Plus, even if you drop out it's still free for you, you get your 5 grand back and everything."
skrpt,2015-01-05T05:15:30.756Z,@mxys I highly recommend Hack Reactor.  I have three friends who went through already.  One of them is a good friend Patrick https://twitter.com/gdi2290/ who became CTO for Keychain Logistics after HR.
mxys,2015-01-05T05:16:10.636Z,@iyeager2004 I spoke to the people at CodeSchool about hiring practices and their opinions on coding bootcamps and they emphasized that you still need to do some self-study in algorithms and CS to be a a good hire - so it's not surprising that a lot of the students at app academy should have a strong CS background
mxys,2015-01-05T05:18:17.169Z,"@codeshi Code, thanks. Just checked out his feed. Hack Reactor is another I'll look into."
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:18:24.221Z,"@mxys I would tend to agree. I've self-taught myself (no degree) into a position writing firmware in c/c++ and it was a lot of hard-work and luck that has helped me land the jobs I have. If I would've had a degree, it would've been cake. "
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:19:16.816Z,I'm hoping my current work experience with some portfolio work from FCC with the non-profits will help me turn this web app work into something a little easier than getting my foot in the door using self-taught C.
mxys,2015-01-05T05:19:36.789Z,"@iyeager2004 Wow, that's quite an accomplishment! I'm not super keen on going back to get a second degree, so I'm more into the self-study/bootcamp route myself."
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:20:08.755Z,@mxys What's your current degree in?
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:21:45.425Z,*you're... 
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:21:56.042Z,"*your... Damn, it's getting late."
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:21:56.369Z,nope you had it right
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:22:01.142Z,you're is for you are :)
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:22:05.015Z,ahh you caught it lol
mxys,2015-01-05T05:22:07.271Z,@iyeager2004 Poli Sci - been working in Chinese law firms since graduating but I'm not loving it
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:24:24.331Z,"@mxys Most of the HR people I've discussed this stuff with say they look for a four year degree, they don't care if it's CS or Sanskrit, just that you sat down for four years and toughed it out, so don't get too down. "
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:24:54.626Z,"@odrisck Yeah, I think my marathon of codeschool today was a bad idea. :)"
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:25:03.196Z,lol
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:25:11.319Z,Hey I been working on my redesign :)
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:25:18.154Z,cool
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:25:20.605Z,Not finished but here it is so far
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:25:21.769Z,http://iheartkode.com/2/
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:25:27.811Z,No bootstrap lol
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:25:38.748Z,its responsive some :P
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:25:55.516Z,its a very green green
mxys,2015-01-05T05:26:05.642Z,@iheartkode Looks great! Nice url :clap: 
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:26:08.926Z,Green ftw
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:26:20.646Z,are my eyeballs suppose to ache on the sides? :)
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:26:21.706Z,Colors are not final lol
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:27:03.488Z,@iheartkode Looks good. You should have those top buttons center in the div when the width drops below 500.
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:27:04.065Z,Thank you @mxys 
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:27:15.523Z,It supposed to
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:27:22.116Z,@iheartkode But I'm digging the green.
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:27:25.549Z,I have a media query for it
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:27:52.087Z,for some reason the media query is not working :/
bboyjacks,2015-01-05T05:28:14.027Z,I  started Eloquent Javascript today. This is awesome it has execises
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:28:19.839Z,yusss
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:28:23.981Z,It is awesome.
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:28:29.969Z,Hmm.... Did you add --webkit and --moz cases for it?
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:28:47.838Z,Erm no
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:29:13.719Z,I thought media queries were good in all browsers
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:30:22.164Z,That skyline is San Diego :P
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T05:31:26.222Z,"Yeah, weird, in Chrome I'm not seeing any of your media changes taking effect when I drop the width."
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:31:34.460Z,"@iheartkode I suggest not using an image for the i<3kode logo type thing (henceforth known as logo) if you can avoid doing so. seems like it should be replicateable in the page with just text and an image/font-icon/svg for the heart. also I’d say use an svg for the logo instead of png, just cause it is resolution independent so it wont degrade on hiDPI screens"
mxys,2015-01-05T05:32:31.436Z,"@iheartkode for the green, maybe you could try #28d079 instead"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:32:35.030Z,"Yea that's true, I was lazy and not very good at css yet."
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:32:52.104Z,colors are not final lol
mxys,2015-01-05T05:32:57.129Z,it's the green used in this chat - pretty similar but a bit calmer
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:33:13.816Z,Yea I need it calmer indeed thanks
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:34:03.977Z,you havent made the social icons actual links - but it’s not done yet anyway
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:34:36.971Z,Yea still a lot to do.
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:35:12.707Z,28d079  yea i like that color :)
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:35:36.457Z,btw don’t let text just get SUPER WIDE as the page expands - generally you’d want to limit it to a certain width
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:36:17.184Z,I'm not sure how to do that without messing up the responsive part
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:36:35.454Z,max-width
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:36:43.409Z,@mxys  refresh
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:37:00.117Z,Yea I wasn't sure if that would mess it up I will try 
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:37:11.766Z,"ohh better, no eyeball ache"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:37:24.271Z,yea i did random green lol
mxys,2015-01-05T05:37:29.922Z,@iheartkode perfect! :thumbsup: 
apexpred,2015-01-05T05:37:51.171Z,yea the green is nice
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:37:57.836Z,just did the border bottom also lol
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:38:48.932Z,"mmm

```
@media screen and (min-width: value) {
  selector {
    max-width: value;
  }
}
```"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:40:21.499Z,when i do max-width: it makes the width smaller so it doesnt fill the whole width of the page
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:40:29.401Z,to apply it just to non mobile narrowed versions - but since it’s a max-width it doesn’t matter!
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:40:42.222Z,exactly - that’s the point
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:40:55.797Z,but the background shrinks
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:41:09.046Z,I need to do maxwidth to the p
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:41:10.364Z,lol
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:41:12.853Z,I’m not sure I follow
apexpred,2015-01-05T05:41:23.689Z,than make the min-width larger
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:41:24.776Z,well.. max-width to the container of the text
apexpred,2015-01-05T05:42:18.590Z,it looks good now
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:42:23.671Z,"you don’t actually need the media query bit when declaring a max-width, unless you have a different max-width defined for the narrower states"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:42:42.592Z,okay
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:42:46.734Z,brb
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:43:38.477Z,i changed the green section p maxwidth
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:44:20.529Z,the brown part is borked
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:44:25.864Z,brown?
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:44:34.806Z,"above the green, looks brown to me"
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:44:43.707Z,"you need to center it, the black/brown part"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:44:46.364Z,lol it's dark grey
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:44:53.493Z,the text moved over left then it stayed there
odrisck,2015-01-05T05:45:04.989Z,"I'm old, it looks brown, don't hate"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:45:14.213Z,the text is justified
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:45:41.797Z,that’s not what’s causing it
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:47:16.861Z,`margin: 0 auto;` to center
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:48:05.367Z,the projects section is center just not the text
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:48:30.055Z,"but you shouldn’t be applying those styles to `p`, perhaps a specific class, or a container for the text"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:48:39.167Z,ok
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:48:41.562Z,unless you want the text like that. is that your intention?
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:49:11.976Z,left aligned yes
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:49:34.100Z,"yes the text left aligned, but still centered"
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:49:44.881Z,"as in, in the middle of the page."
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:49:58.785Z,not to the side
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:50:25.202Z,i'm confused lol
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:50:33.310Z,Been a long day lol
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:51:10.945Z,"okay, do you know how to use the chrome (assuming you’re on chrome) developer tools?"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:51:20.544Z,yes
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:51:40.704Z,can we drag attachments onto here?
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:51:57.462Z,you can link images
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:53:23.341Z,[![Screen Shot 2015-01-05 at 05.52.47.png](https://files.gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/HF7M/thumb/Screen-Shot-2015-01-05-at-05.52.47.png)](https://files.gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/HF7M/Screen-Shot-2015-01-05-at-05.52.47.png)
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:54:08.302Z,oh I see
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:54:11.880Z,:)
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:56:17.290Z,"no no, not text-align:center. margin: 0 auto"
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:56:36.363Z,"ah okay, haha, delayed reaction"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:56:49.316Z,lol
iheartkode,2015-01-05T05:58:27.486Z,Say you have margin: 0 auto;  what if i want it centered but i also want to add bottom margin with out effecting the center
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:59:17.095Z,sure
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T05:59:46.185Z,let’s learn about what the shorcut forms of certain properties
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:00:51.897Z,"`margin: 0 auto;` is actually short for `margin: 0 auto 0 auto;`, which is short for `margin-top: 0; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left: auto;`"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:01:22.656Z,ok
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:01:39.282Z,"there’s other properties that work the same way, or similarly"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:01:45.196Z,i could do margin left auto and margin right auto
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:02:02.771Z,then I could have a margin-bottom:
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:02:19.029Z,"yes, or `margin: 0 auto 10px;`"
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:02:41.401Z,which will just be expanded to `margin: 0 auto 10px auto;`
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:02:59.859Z,right ok
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:03:23.440Z,This is my first hand at responsive lol
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:03:29.352Z,still tons to learn
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:03:31.385Z,so it starts at the top and works clockwise
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:03:39.445Z,"no problem, I’m happy to help"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:04:05.955Z,I will make a heart svg and do a transparent background in css
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:04:24.101Z,purpose?
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:04:38.647Z,so it's scalable?
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:05:45.846Z,I am not too concerned it works on smaller size
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:06:10.498Z,3 hours later I have half a site lol
odrisck,2015-01-05T06:06:31.752Z,lol
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:06:52.672Z,I will finish it tomorrow I am tired of css for the day
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:07:22.251Z,"According to rescue time  30 mins in google, w3c and other sites lol"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:07:55.618Z,25m in gitter :P
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:10:28.178Z,haha I meant more about the transparent background

iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:11:15.046Z,white text on that image bg  is hard to read with out a shade of color
mxys,2015-01-05T06:11:19.772Z,@iheartkode I just installed Rescue Time too! Interested (and maybe scared) to see where all my online time is spent.
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:11:24.244Z,and don’t you already have the heart? you don’t need to make it if you’ve already got it.  unless the version you have isn’t in a scalable format. I assume it was exported from a program like illustrator
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:11:46.727Z,yes i have the svg
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:12:00.106Z,time rescue puts me in check lol
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:12:17.949Z,it deducts when you are on distracting sites lol
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:12:37.929Z,my productivity for the last 3 hours was 90%

iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:14:41.949Z,Why
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:14:51.321Z,"@iheartkode oh I see what you mean - sure, yeah if you turn to logo into text and svg you’d want to replicate the background with dark gray and adding some transparency"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T06:15:34.387Z,I will try it see if I can get the spacing good
pedromaltez,2015-01-05T06:16:44.642Z,"alright, I should’ve gone to bed a long time ago - I’ll talk to you later :) good luck"

seahik,2015-01-05T12:05:22.003Z,"ah ok im still sorting it all out, but Im fairly sure design is not my thing, so trying to understand what the options are"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:07:10.478Z,I watched this video yesterday that was referenced on reddit.  [Web Development Career advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXqs6X0lzKI&list=PLoem0-yXMB1B8unY9xunkTFxYR3hWp8zb)
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:07:38.259Z,">capslock title
>seems legit"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:08:15.341Z,So I'm guessing if I'm not interested in design...then focusing on node or ruby and database etc is the way to go
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:09:51.023Z,"well, what are you interested in"
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:10:09.063Z,process of elimination in this niche is a strange career deciding method
seahik,2015-01-05T12:11:14.236Z,ah maybe true
seahik,2015-01-05T12:11:28.616Z,i feel steered by several things other than what i'm interested in
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:12:04.936Z,I take it back-- like the video although I think it might be overwhelming to people coming into the field though...
seahik,2015-01-05T12:12:48.403Z,"including:  job market, availability of online learning materials"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:13:06.911Z,learning curve
seahik,2015-01-05T12:13:21.294Z,potential work atmosphere
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:14:02.753Z,seems like a good conversation...
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:14:17.893Z,"Well, I think that programming is something you have to swim in the deep end for a bit to get a sense of whether or not it is for you. Maybe, would you say, that you could dedicate the 100hrs or whatever to completing the FreeCodeCamp course and if its not for you, then it's not for you?"
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:14:34.920Z,"and you get to taste everything, front end back end etc"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:14:58.557Z,i have taken a few programming courses actually in HS and college and enjoy it
seahik,2015-01-05T12:15:59.404Z,"i came to codecamp because of the organization of online tutorials, but i'm still learning about job positions"
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:18:21.246Z,Freelancing is also an option
seahik,2015-01-05T12:19:34.307Z,im not sure im savvy enough for that
seahik,2015-01-05T12:19:46.783Z,i actually have felt most comfortable working for large companies
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:22:27.685Z,"From what I understand, as a software engineer in way-larger companies, you would probably be using some time of enterprise coding language like java or C#"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:22:32.551Z,but like you say my thinking is it is great to go through all the tutorials on here to get exposed to different tools
seahik,2015-01-05T12:22:46.293Z,yes im becoming aware of that
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:24:12.695Z,"on average, how many hours a day was spent on this course?"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:24:22.816Z,i'm about ready to start the node and angular tutorials
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:24:34.137Z,for the first 100 hours followed by the remaining 900
seahik,2015-01-05T12:24:54.935Z,@cheezedigital I think it is completely up to the individual
seahik,2015-01-05T12:25:09.067Z,self-paced for whatever time you would like to spend
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:25:13.850Z,"yea, I understand"
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:26:01.976Z,"i mean realistically, i try to put in 1 - 2 hours during the week, and then marathon on the weekends, but I'm beginning to see burntout"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:27:06.221Z,@cheezedigital ah yeah ive felt that at times.  not sure the best way to deal with it
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:27:41.933Z,420kush420 up there's got something that'll help
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:27:44.950Z,@420kush420 
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:28:40.687Z,420kush
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:29:06.492Z,@seahik all good. 
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:30:29.986Z,I think you stop being burned out when you have fun
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:30:52.233Z,"if you're just following tutorials and tutorials and like, waiting to have fun or for the eureka moment that never happens"
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:30:57.409Z,you're gonna stop liking what you're doing
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:31:33.669Z,"once you figure out how to kind of get things working, take that amateur understanding and set of with a goal to do something. build something that you want to build. that you need in your life."
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:32:34.571Z,The fun part about understanding english is not obsessing about the grammar
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:32:47.783Z,it's singing and prose and poetry
serhiicss,2015-01-05T12:33:31.830Z,@teddy-error very good point
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:33:33.003Z,i see
serhiicss,2015-01-05T12:33:40.327Z,Inspiration is a must
seahik,2015-01-05T12:35:07.118Z,I've been a little torn about pushing further through the tutorials.  Versus taking time to start trying to create little tests in codepen to use what I've learned.
seahik,2015-01-05T12:35:51.083Z,Probably will try to do a little of both
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:36:15.362Z,"yea, I've done that, and i need to move forward, as I've neglected all js, and ajax"
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:36:19.345Z,or front end
seahik,2015-01-05T12:37:13.296Z,I'm also waiting to start the node tutorials when I have time so i an maximize the codeschool trial
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:37:23.974Z,I see
seahik,2015-01-05T12:37:31.520Z,<---cheap
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:37:41.276Z,i think there are torrents of the codeschool stuff somewhere
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:37:44.835Z,so node will be your go to back end?
seahik,2015-01-05T12:38:13.686Z,not sure! but that is what Free Code Camp is designed with.  The MEAN stack
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:38:30.184Z,right on
seahik,2015-01-05T12:38:32.469Z,so i'm keen to learn more about it to see what its like
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:38:38.836Z,"yea, all good"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:40:38.045Z,having a fair amount of difficult with the coderbyte challenges
seahik,2015-01-05T12:40:55.487Z,ive done about half of the easy ones
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-05T12:41:02.543Z,"The MEAN stack should have been the RAWR stack, although it doesn't stand for anything :("
seahik,2015-01-05T12:41:52.813Z,i feel like there is a gap of learning between finishing the codecademy JS course and transitiioning to solving the coderbyte challenges
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:41:57.775Z,"yea, I'm not familiar with coderbyte, so will bookmark"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:42:58.523Z,It is challenge #34
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:43:22.764Z,"Like most things, it is difficult to come up with a single weighted sum of the value of a programmer. I prefer to evaluate multiple axis independently. Programming is really just the mundane aspect of expressing a solution to a problem. There are talents that are specifically related to actually coding, but the real issue is being able to grasp problems and devise solutions that are detailed enough to actually be coded. Being able to clearly keep a lot of aspects of a complex system visualized is valuable. Having a good feel for time and storage that is flexible enough to work over a range of ten orders of magnitude is valuable. Experience is valuable. Knowing the literature is valuable. Being able to integrate methods and knowledge from different fields is valuable. Being consistent is valuable. Being creative is valuable. Focus is extremely important. Being able to maintain focus for the length of a project gets harder and harder as schedules grow longer, but it is critical to doing great work. "
seahik,2015-01-05T12:43:25.071Z,encouraged to pair program for it
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:43:36.063Z,@seahik Have you paired through any of the Coderbyte challenges?
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:43:36.164Z,>Programming is really just the mundane aspect of expressing a solution to a problem.
seahik,2015-01-05T12:44:02.771Z,"@yaskyj no not yet, i know i should try it!"
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:44:08.234Z,i think programming is actual about building muscle memory
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:44:26.374Z,programming is football
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:44:28.865Z,while solving problems
seahik,2015-01-05T12:45:19.957Z,"before I joined FCC, i was doing coding challenges on a website called Codeabbey.  I loved it there, I think the problems were easier or something"
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:45:54.126Z,@seahik You can always come here or to the https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/LetsPair chat room for pairing. I'm usually up for pairing too.
seahik,2015-01-05T12:47:07.450Z,@yaskyj ok thanks so much.  I will see if you are around later this week.  But I guess I'm worried that it is more of a personal tutoring session if I get lost?
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:48:02.241Z,@seahik The first couple of code pairing sessions you probably won't even say anything. That's how it went for me. It just takes practice.
seahik,2015-01-05T12:48:19.537Z,haha ok
seahik,2015-01-05T12:49:21.172Z,i'm trying to read Eloquent JS.   And trying to learn about other learning tools
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:49:34.580Z,You can also watch the old pair programming sessions.
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T12:49:46.780Z,and anyone can jump on pair programming?
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:49:52.447Z,FCC does them once a week.
seahik,2015-01-05T12:50:04.378Z,ah thats good idea...i was also thinking about videos for learning in general
seahik,2015-01-05T12:50:14.827Z,if there is a good JS youtube channel
teddy-error,2015-01-05T12:52:06.275Z,"these are more historical but an interesting series:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7664379246A246CB"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:52:35.077Z,ah cool thanks
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:52:56.004Z,I'm trying to find the link for the older FCC pair programming sessions.
seahik,2015-01-05T12:53:17.329Z,"I'm about half way through this one, which has been helpful.   [The Definitive Guide to Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMfcsYzj-9M)"
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:53:28.082Z,Here you go: http://www.freecodecamp.com/live-pair-programming
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:53:59.170Z,@cheezedigital  Do you mean during the live event or just coming into the chat rooms?
seahik,2015-01-05T12:54:01.353Z,ah thanks so much going to watch one right now! 
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:54:24.341Z,I think they're every Tuesday night.
seahik,2015-01-05T12:55:48.068Z,ah the first one was vowel count....that challenge I found easy.
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:56:31.573Z,The fun thing is to see people's different approaches to the same problem.
seahik,2015-01-05T12:56:42.293Z,it's strange some of the first CB challenges in the easy section I found more difficult than one's later in the list.  
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:57:12.964Z,"Yes, and some of the mediums have the same exact answers as the easy one."
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:57:38.033Z,"The counting minutes was particularly changing for an ""easy"" question."
seahik,2015-01-05T12:58:24.766Z,I think that is why I really enjoyed CodeAbbey....it scaled up in difficulty as you go along.  And the author writes more of an introduction about the challenge
Maximization,2015-01-05T12:58:43.597Z,"@seahik codeabbey was great, I did a bunch of them with Java"
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T12:59:01.218Z,Good morning everyone. Is it actually pre-5AM? 
yaskyj,2015-01-05T12:59:18.967Z,Not for me.
Maximization,2015-01-05T12:59:24.356Z,"@yaskyj  or @seahik thanks for the youtube link on being a web dev, watched another video from him, great guy"
seahik,2015-01-05T12:59:29.189Z,"@Maximization ah nice!  I think the whole ranking believer, follower, fanatic, acolyte was really fun too"
Maximization,2015-01-05T12:59:36.787Z,haha yeah
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T12:59:46.088Z,@yaskyj Lucky.
yaskyj,2015-01-05T13:00:07.980Z,"Now, I'm not saying that I haven't been up since before 5am..."
seahik,2015-01-05T13:00:28.557Z,@iyeager2004 2pm here!
Maximization,2015-01-05T13:00:47.517Z,"hey, same for me"
Maximization,2015-01-05T13:00:50.586Z,where do you live

iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:01:52.753Z,"I stayed up till 2 since I thought I'd get a crack at some of the coderbyte challenges meaning to stop at midnight, but of course I didn't. Finished up the Easy ones last night. Up at 3:45 to take in-laws to airport to ship them back home. "
Maximization,2015-01-05T13:01:57.392Z,"Nice, haven't visited yet but will sometime"
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:02:25.700Z,@seahik Is that how Sean Connery says Sweden?
seahik,2015-01-05T13:02:25.775Z,"@Maximization i got that youtube vid from reddit. i thought it was great too, informative and entertaing...always a great combo!"

seahik,2015-01-05T13:03:51.172Z,@iyeager2004 haha yeah...i think its how its spelled in german....oh its Zweden in dutch @Maximization ?
Maximization,2015-01-05T13:04:17.628Z,Zweden!
seahik,2015-01-05T13:05:14.638Z,wow its so cool that you can watch the video in the chat room
teddy-error,2015-01-05T13:06:05.258Z,Step 1) Be a woman
seahik,2015-01-05T13:06:11.739Z,he is a good speaker
yaskyj,2015-01-05T13:08:30.281Z,"You can watch it, if your company hasn't blocked youtube :("
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:08:57.631Z,"They've unearthed the tomb of Osiris (God of the Dead) in Egypt. Someday people will be combing through the crap that we leave behind, wonder if we'll look as cool to those people as the ancient egyptians look to us."
yaskyj,2015-01-05T13:09:58.214Z,Well they will certainly thing we worshipped cats.
seahik,2015-01-05T13:10:15.761Z,hahaha
teddy-error,2015-01-05T13:10:33.289Z,I don't think so. We really mythologize ancient civilizations because of sparse recorded history. We live in a time where almost 7 billion-ish people are actively documenting every day.
seahik,2015-01-05T13:10:43.287Z,man i read a somewhat disturbig thing about cats today
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:10:51.089Z,That they'll eat you.
seahik,2015-01-05T13:10:56.561Z,haha yes.
seahik,2015-01-05T13:11:06.388Z,i cant look at my cat in the eye 
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:11:07.686Z,I try to stay off the front page of reddit until I'm post-coffee.
yaskyj,2015-01-05T13:11:26.353Z,They will steal your breath while you sleep?
yaskyj,2015-01-05T13:13:49.116Z,Jack London might have a different take on that.

seahik,2015-01-05T13:14:45.136Z,i regret bringing this up....lol
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:14:49.802Z,"Woah, check out this jsbin... http://jsbin.com/battery-status-test/edit?html,output browser can access your battery information from your device."
seahik,2015-01-05T13:15:35.465Z,oh yeah i think i saw that tested...pretty neat!
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:16:23.790Z,Looking at that JS with all those getElementById calls make me happy that FCC forced me to get interested in learning JjQuery.
seahik,2015-01-05T13:16:39.670Z,i just realized recently that i can see my partners phone battery info through find my iphone.  i thought that was pretty cool
seahik,2015-01-05T13:17:43.557Z,@iyeager2004 oh yeah i was reading google map API info
seahik,2015-01-05T13:18:12.518Z,and it doesnt use jquery...it was a bit challenging
teddy-error,2015-01-05T13:18:39.098Z,but can you see their front camera...
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:19:32.092Z,@seahik  I won't go back. I've already done a first pass on my personal page and while I'm re-writing it to add some awesomeness I'll be converting it over to all jQ calls. 
seahik,2015-01-05T13:19:40.178Z,i was trying to insert a google map into my test website.  I got that figured out but wanted it to open when a button clicked
seahik,2015-01-05T13:20:50.284Z,I'm stuck trying to understand the code and instuctions for asynchronous loading 
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:21:42.140Z,"Want to put your code up somewhere, I'll take a look at it. Maybe (probably) can't help much, but sometimes having another set of eyes helps."
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:21:51.711Z,I can't take a look at it until later this evening.
seahik,2015-01-05T13:22:12.925Z,ah cool that would be great....i think I fiddled with it too much and screwed it up...I'll try to get it back to where it can be better troubleshooted and post it later.  thanks
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:24:38.210Z,No problem. Shoot me a message if I'm not on here. I'm back to actual work today so I won't be around as much.
seahik,2015-01-05T13:25:14.356Z,"okdoke thanks very much
"
seahik,2015-01-05T13:26:55.505Z,this is the code I've been trying to use [Google Maps JS API -Asynchronous Loading](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-simple-async)
seahik,2015-01-05T13:27:58.444Z,I have a button on my codepen testsite that I would like to trigger opening the map.  I'm not sure if that is feasible or not to do on codepen.
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:29:37.692Z,Why not open the map into a hidden div on load and show the div on the button click? 
seahik,2015-01-05T13:30:30.382Z,yes I think that is what I was doing.  I was trying to have the click add class that is shown?
vineesh1,2015-01-05T13:31:01.047Z,"Quick question guys - Does the pair programming have to be really done in pairs? If so, how?"
kmele1,2015-01-05T13:31:23.864Z,Hi! Noob here...
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T13:31:27.427Z,"So, we have a weather advisory today. -30°F/-34.5°C"
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:31:36.779Z,@vineesh1 The easiest way to do the pair programming is Screen Hero or TeamViewer.
iyeager2004,2015-01-05T13:31:54.999Z,@sircharleswatson Well. That sucks.
vineesh1,2015-01-05T13:32:11.069Z,@iyeager2004 Yup. Have worked with Team Viewer before. But how do I find a partner? :-)
seahik,2015-01-05T13:32:37.295Z,"@iyeager2004 its probabaly easier if I just have my code available...i'll get it later, thanks"

towwiow,2015-01-05T15:05:28.540Z,@Phonbopit - yup. I've gone over the time subjection on every challenge so far.
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:05:38.846Z,@Phonbopit Excellent. 
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:05:49.614Z,what challenge are you guys on this morning/afternoon/evening?
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:06:10.604Z,depending where you are 
cshutchinson,2015-01-05T15:07:31.387Z,"my goal is to finish 21,22, 23 before bed, but after work"
cshutchinson,2015-01-05T15:08:46.021Z,maybe do 21 during lunch break
Phonbopit,2015-01-05T15:10:34.517Z,"I setup my goal to challenge 2-3 hrs/day after work , Now in Bangkok, Thailand , 10:09 PM "

johnstonbl01,2015-01-05T15:13:38.598Z,"Catching up on e-mails first, setting up necessary meetings for the next few weeks and then reviewing goals for 2015."
johnstonbl01,2015-01-05T15:13:58.590Z,And probably setting up a personal domain.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T15:17:35.985Z,@johnstonbl01 What do you do again?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T15:19:29.244Z,@Phonbopit Don't worry. the times next to each challenge are just estimations.
johnstonbl01,2015-01-05T15:22:46.799Z,@sircharleswatson I manage a global operations team for Nielsen.

admhlt,2015-01-05T15:34:10.775Z,"Pay is always good, @StevenKW :)"
StevenKW,2015-01-05T15:34:44.805Z,This is true :) @admhlt hopefully I learn a lot.
admhlt,2015-01-05T15:38:27.043Z,"My company deals with C, Java, and C#. I don't work on that side but I'm exposed to APIs and programming terms a lot, so I kind of pick up stuff along the way. Approach PHP in that way and it'll be tangentially useful. :)"
AhsanBudhani,2015-01-05T15:39:34.595Z,"If any freelance work is available .. please contact me I use PHP, HTML and CSS"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:42:05.395Z,@StevenKW  Well you’ve got to pay the bills! It’s a shame you don’t get to do double duty using JS for the gig 
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:42:25.636Z,that’d be so ideal
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:43:34.296Z,"there are lots of PHP jobs still kicking around, so once you know both you’ll be that much more employable "
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T15:43:34.986Z,"@StevenKW If it's a new project, you should just start it in JS :P See if they notice haha"
StevenKW,2015-01-05T15:44:15.844Z,@figitalboy yeah I was really focusing on JS so I was surprised to get the gig. But yeah I was in school all 2014 with no income so yeah I need to pay some bills.
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:44:28.310Z,I hear you man. Congrats on finding the gig!
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T15:45:21.335Z,@StevenKW congrats
StevenKW,2015-01-05T15:45:39.834Z,@sircharleswatson This is a junior position. I am hoping I'll get some mentorship and training along the way.
nassosstylianou,2015-01-05T15:45:58.229Z,"morning everyone (afternoon here), going through the Stanford lectures as I've got day off work today, now on Week 4 (challenge 21)"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:46:35.903Z,awesome. way to seize that time “off” 
nassosstylianou,2015-01-05T15:48:25.132Z,"@figitalboy  yeah, exactly :)
pretty dreadful weather here so excuse to stay in and go through challenges"
Maximization,2015-01-05T15:48:47.264Z,want to know something nice? if you type window in the console of your browser's dev tool you will get the global scope of the type of the browser you're using which in return defines the javascript engine that it's running
Maximization,2015-01-05T15:49:30.347Z,you can find all the preloaded libraries in there like the Math library and all its constants such as Math.PI
Maximization,2015-01-05T15:51:14.066Z,so that's the back scenery of all the javascript code run on the web
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:53:29.723Z,cool tip @Maximization 
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T15:55:28.526Z,"it was windy overnight, and i had a window open. Ended up having a dream that I programmed an app that could make it windy"

nassosstylianou,2015-01-05T15:58:20.511Z,haha that's amazing. no remote control to spot it raining though ;\
johnstonbl01,2015-01-05T15:59:37.068Z,@nassosstylianou I really liked the guy that taught the Stanford lectures.
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T15:59:45.828Z,"@figitalboy yep, me too. I often times dream that I have to define a route and configure all the middleware in order to get somewhere"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T16:00:10.770Z,@figitalboy I dreamt about code last night :)
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:00:24.833Z,I also recently had a dream about recursion that was about the strangest dream I can ever remember having
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T16:00:46.690Z,that’s so cool
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:00:51.618Z,I also recently had a dream about recursion that was about the strangest dream I can ever remember having
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:00:54.466Z,;)

AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-05T16:06:35.799Z,No offense intended. It's just funny how cool it sounds in our own head compared to how it sounds to others.
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:09:56.193Z,"none taken, and probably a personal fault but other’s reactions to my dreams is on the same order of importance to me as whether or not they’ve checked their mail lately or erased the messages from their answering machine :)"

Maximization,2015-01-05T16:16:51.434Z,"@sircharleswatson the hall-pass doesn't take the time of the day in consideration when you revoke it, so it's best to revoke in the morning so you have the most of the day remaining"

sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T16:18:42.584Z,"well, looks like I have already used a hall-pass in the past. So I can't get a new one :P"

QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T16:43:34.379Z,@jasonwatkins Glad to have you on board!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T16:45:35.245Z,@trisell @johnstonbl01 That cloth simulation is incredible.
seahik,2015-01-05T16:47:36.898Z,@Maximization the hall-pass is that for code-school?  does it factor in time zones?  so if I start in morning here it will give me full 48 hours?
jasonwatkins,2015-01-05T16:48:27.134Z,"Thanks guys, looking forward to lots of cool stuff!"
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:49:00.499Z,"@seahik hmm, I'm not sure if it looks at the server time or client time but from what I've noticed it gave me about 1.5 day and it presumably stopped at midnight on day 2"
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:49:30.200Z,because I checked back in before 48 hours have passed and it was gone
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:50:11.817Z,"I think it looks at your own clock btw, that would make sense"
seahik,2015-01-05T16:50:15.133Z,"ah ok so midnight in your time zone, do you think?"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T16:50:19.728Z,@trisell I don’t know whether to be inspired or resigned to the fact that I could never...
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T16:50:30.538Z,I think i’ll choose inspired :D
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:51:00.882Z,"@seahik yeah, so best start in the morning so you have the full day ahead of day 1"
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:51:35.347Z,"either way don't worry, I managed to complete both node.js and angular.js within 24 hours, so you have a decent margin there"
trisell,2015-01-05T16:51:40.409Z,"@QuincyLarson I look at these to motivate myself that choosing to go with Javascript is the correct choice. I continue to have my mind blown with what can be done in the browser these days. It's definitely the way of the future to build browser based applications.
"
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:51:53.345Z,"*node.js and express.js, angular is free"
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:52:31.145Z,honestly nodeschool teaches you the same stuff codeschool does
seahik,2015-01-05T16:53:29.226Z,oh they are free? thanks very much for the tip...i was hoping to do some extra tutorials during the pass time
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:53:47.118Z,http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:53:59.765Z,you’ll need to set up your development environment first
seahik,2015-01-05T16:54:02.150Z,@terakilobyte ah ok yeah i think i started those before
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:54:08.136Z,"angular is free, node.js and express.js aren't"
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:54:38.081Z,"@terakilobyte how was your flight back home, slept through most of it?"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T16:55:03.078Z,@terakilobyte I was just about to play with doing nodeschool on cloud9
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:55:27.830Z,wide awake for 15 out of 17 hours of it
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:55:52.896Z,"we flew over northern alaska, I got some good pictures of the aurora"
seahik,2015-01-05T16:56:13.859Z,@sircharleswatson Have you had good luck with cloud9. I've heard it can be slow?  But maybe I wouldnt notice just doing tutorials.
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:56:43.285Z,cloud9 is decent but I prefer local
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:56:55.107Z,"oh dang, must've felt like a long flight"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T16:57:15.831Z,"@trisell I agree - JavaScript is the future, and will eventually even dominate the Internet of Things and mobile (though that is still a few years away)"
terakilobyte,2015-01-05T16:57:18.417Z,"@Maximization didn’t feel like it, it was :P"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T16:57:25.462Z,"@seahik Never used it before. Trying it out now.
@terakilobyte I agree, but for the purposes of FCC, with keeping everything in the browser, might be good. idk :P"
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:57:35.622Z,"but at least you saw auroras, that's beautiful, still need to see my first one yet"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T16:58:13.234Z,"@seahik you have to use the Code School Hall Pass, which gives you 2 free days of Code School."
Maximization,2015-01-05T16:58:45.671Z,Someday I'll visit this place http://www.placestoseeinyourlifetime.com/a-true-winter-experience-in-igloo-village-finland-4053/
seahik,2015-01-05T17:00:17.294Z,@QuincyLarson ah yes thanks...maxim gave the tip that the pass seems to end at midnight rather than 48 hours from the start.  Useful for those who wanted to do try extra tutorials during the trial/pass period.   You get closer to full 48 hours if you start the pass in the morning.
seahik,2015-01-05T17:02:38.240Z,@Maximization wow that would be great to watch northern lights ...all toasty inside
benstoltz,2015-01-05T17:04:09.497Z,"I miss the northern lights, they are so beautiful :)"

sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T17:46:25.129Z,>The stock browser on the Samsung Galaxy S4 with Android 4.2 does not support the border-radius shorthand property but does support the long-hand properties for each corner like border-top-left-radius.
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-05T17:46:25.898Z,@benstoltz It looks like prefixr.com lists the future proof style before the vendor prefixes. Isn't that bad?
apexpred,2015-01-05T17:46:35.795Z,I love brackets
iheartkode,2015-01-05T17:46:39.091Z,^

AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-05T17:48:02.422Z,"Ok. I just remember reading that future proof should be listed last, after vendor prefixes, so that the browser will use the standard style once it is adopted."
jenthebest,2015-01-05T17:48:03.059Z,NOOO not the song!
jenthebest,2015-01-05T17:48:08.570Z,:)

iheartkode,2015-01-05T17:53:19.621Z,"default Android.. Jelly Bean... Like I said this phone is old, but works like a charm"
apexpred,2015-01-05T17:53:38.606Z,This is why sass is awesome. No worrys about prefixes
odrisck,2015-01-05T17:53:57.858Z,"sass confuses me, I'll learn it though, I have read enough job boards to know I should"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T17:54:02.869Z,@iheartkode the default browser is known to be vulnerable to viruses. You should avoid it 
iheartkode,2015-01-05T17:54:03.714Z,I need to learn sass lol
iheartkode,2015-01-05T17:54:27.560Z,I had chrome but it takes so much memory on my phone kills the battery
piecedigital,2015-01-05T17:54:29.457Z,I'm gonna go learn SASS
piecedigital,2015-01-05T17:54:40.756Z,I went to the website but they didnt have but one page.
iheartkode,2015-01-05T17:54:45.155Z,i will get firefox lol
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T17:54:50.927Z,good idea
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T17:54:59.586Z,I'm also using Firefox Beta on Android
apexpred,2015-01-05T17:55:02.991Z,I don't know everything. But just learning basic sass is worth it
iheartkode,2015-01-05T17:55:03.742Z,installing now
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T17:55:21.196Z,Much faster and stable then Chrome Beta(I'm a beta fan!)

apexpred,2015-01-05T17:57:16.144Z,It kind of does
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T17:57:32.018Z,"On pc, i'm a Chrome fan but on mobile, firefox is the boss"
piecedigital,2015-01-05T17:57:43.858Z,I had several bugs on my site for mobile that worked in the mobile mode in the Chrome browser

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T17:59:11.585Z,doesn't look good
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T17:59:21.545Z,"So, for anyone that doesn't like having a lot of windows open on their computer, I highly recommend using iTerm2 for your terminal and setting it as fullscreen. then create a system hotkey to open/close it"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T17:59:34.018Z,i use tmux
iheartkode,2015-01-05T17:59:55.353Z,The problem was android browser its old lol
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T18:00:01.182Z,do you do your editing in their? with vim?
odrisck,2015-01-05T18:00:04.835Z,"well I'm going to set my dev up on another screen, and try that again :)"
AnthonyIsaacs,2015-01-05T18:00:05.090Z,Ah.
greg-js,2015-01-05T18:00:26.435Z,But you can't bring up tmux with a hotkey can you? you need tilda or guake or something for that
iheartkode,2015-01-05T18:00:36.252Z,I don't use vim lol
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T18:01:05.165Z,I like that setup because you don't have to be on a certain workspace for your terminal. just press the hotkey and you have a terminal anywhere. and you can also have it start-up with your computer so it's always available

Wynda,2015-01-05T18:30:55.364Z,Are we able to go through all of the lessons more than once?  I was thinking maybe do all of them and then go back and redo them again just to make sure I remember everything.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T18:31:32.623Z,@Wynda sure you can
odrisck,2015-01-05T18:31:33.318Z,"certainly, you can go through anything as often as you need for it to sink in"

EzequielBruni,2015-01-05T18:38:53.617Z,Hello all.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T18:39:20.583Z,Hello @EzequielBruni 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T18:39:28.833Z,@AmmarAliShah yes - our forum is a Rails app that runs on Ubuntu
apexpred,2015-01-05T18:39:33.607Z,Hi
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T18:40:15.684Z,@QuincyLarson how do i get started with Ruby on Ubuntu? I've already installed it using the terminal as mentioned before
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T18:40:42.883Z,"@Wynda You can go through the lessons again, but I would recommend just continuing forward. Much of this will only really start to make sense once you’re building apps - the latter 90% of Free Code Camp :)"
LookOnTheBrightSide,2015-01-05T18:42:22.299Z,hey all. Is it possible to have more than 2 people pair programming? 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T18:43:30.657Z,@LookOnTheBrightSide yes - Screen hero’s 2.0 beta supports up to 4
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T18:43:36.604Z,@LookOnTheBrightSide pair does mean two but i guess yes
jsonify,2015-01-05T18:43:38.758Z,typeos != cool
EzequielBruni,2015-01-05T18:46:25.620Z,@QuincyLarson Checking out the challenges now.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T18:52:25.156Z,@phlacin typo*
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T18:52:38.908Z,unless you were talking about blood... lol
LookOnTheBrightSide,2015-01-05T18:52:53.902Z,"just wondering if we can have more personised challenges eg say maybe make a nav menu using css and html. Meet for ""pair programming"" in maybe groups of 4 to show off and explain your code. @QuincyLarson @AmmarAliShah "
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T18:55:24.612Z,@LookOnTheBrightSide @QuincyLarson is in charge of making the challenges but you can always go for it yourself and ask for hep here!
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T18:55:37.297Z,help*
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:03:29.471Z,and there is a live pair programming session if your asking for that
towwiow,2015-01-05T19:12:00.378Z,@towwiow is scouting out freelance web development jobs to see what most are asking for 
EzequielBruni,2015-01-05T19:14:45.151Z,"@towwiow Five years of experience for an entry-level position. Three degrees, at least as many programming languages, Photoshop skills are a plus. Will pay you according to our ""half-and-half"" system which pays you half your salary in real cash, and the other half in experience.

Also, our printer stopped working again. Help?"
EzequielBruni,2015-01-05T19:15:32.175Z,"Bad experiences? Who, me?"
trisell,2015-01-05T19:15:41.368Z,"Don't forget they also want a ""rock start"".
"
johnstonbl01,2015-01-05T19:16:14.037Z,@trisell Does that mean they want to pay for me to trash hotel rooms? :P
EzequielBruni,2015-01-05T19:16:39.507Z,"But not a ""ninja"". They had a ninja once, but he never showed up for work."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T19:16:58.441Z,@EzequielBruni or so they thought
EzequielBruni,2015-01-05T19:17:04.256Z,^
towwiow,2015-01-05T19:20:09.965Z,"@EzequielBruni - hehe, yeah, some of them are kind of unrealistic, others are a lot more realistic and achievable"
EzequielBruni,2015-01-05T19:20:56.863Z,@towwiow Of course.
Wynda,2015-01-05T19:21:20.822Z,Is there a problem with the first lesson.  I put the body tags in but it is not showing it as complete.
Robbertdk,2015-01-05T19:21:50.579Z,Good evening from the Netherlands everyone! I'm just trying FreeCodeCamp out. I have some experience in webdesign and development and want to take it a step further. Especially looking for experience in more complex systems like apps. FreeCodeCamp looks promising so far.
Robbertdk,2015-01-05T19:22:36.947Z,What's your experience so far? Is it challenging enough for a not-so-beginner developer?
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:23:37.220Z,Hello Robbertdk and everyone in the chat.  I am new to FreeCodeCamp as well.  Made my way here by recommendation from StartHere.fm the web development podcast
jenthebest,2015-01-05T19:24:35.090Z,"@Robbertdk some of it is a review and I can cruise through it pretty quickly. I'm learning a lot from everything though, even the stuff I thought would be mostly review has some good new info."
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:26:02.943Z,@whittymakes Welcome
Robbertdk,2015-01-05T19:26:30.735Z,@whittymakes Hi! I came here via reddit.com/r/frontend
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T19:27:13.656Z,@Robbertdk Welcome to FCC! I’d say it’s plenty challenging for someone who has some knowledge. 90% of the curriculum comes in the form of actual development projects. You’ll have a nice review of challenges just before that
Robbertdk,2015-01-05T19:27:40.322Z,"@jenthebest Thanks, I think I'll have the same. Had some aha-moments from the codeschool jquery lessons even though I use it a while"
luijoy,2015-01-05T19:27:57.873Z,How do you get around not having 3 years commercial experience? Can anyone who has gotten a job as a Web Dev comment? I imagine having a strong portfolio and busy github etc. would help.
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:28:05.046Z,@AmmarAliShah Thanks!
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T19:28:08.745Z,@whittymakes Wow that’s awesome. What episode did they mention FCC?
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T19:29:03.825Z,"never mind, I found it. Ep. 13"
Robbertdk,2015-01-05T19:29:08.097Z,@figitalboy Thank you! That's what I like about it. Just looking at tutorials doesn't work for me.
cheezedigital,2015-01-05T19:29:46.996Z,love chat. huge distraction. 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:29:59.323Z,@Robbertdk welcome! You'll enjoy greatly here
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:30:02.503Z,"@figitalboy Yep, ep 13.  Whitney is me by the way.  "
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:30:53.143Z,Well i'm going to sleep
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:30:59.197Z,bye!
Robbertdk,2015-01-05T19:31:13.791Z,@AmmarAliShah Thank you :) Bye!
EzequielBruni,2015-01-05T19:31:25.833Z,"@lui8906 Write. Write until someone pays you to write. Then write about what you do some more 'til your name is in so many places on the web that people come to you instead of the other way around. I didn't do it on purpose, and I'm not a programmer (more of a designer type), but that's what worked for me."
QuincyLarson,2015-01-05T19:31:32.448Z,@AmmarAliShah good night
luijoy,2015-01-05T19:32:11.770Z,Thanks @EzequielBruni :)
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:32:43.952Z,Would anyone recommend learning Ruby on rails along with Free Code Academy?  Or should I just focus on one? 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:33:05.454Z,@whittymakes focus on one
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:33:22.205Z,You won't be able to cope with too many different things
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:33:53.169Z,@AmmarAliShah which one would you choose first?
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T19:34:08.284Z,"FCC is javascript based, and these days there’s not much you CANT do with JS"
odrisck,2015-01-05T19:35:03.200Z,"I'd focus on JS first, I learned a little Ruby but its slowed me down here, where I really feel my focus should be for the moment, I have lots of time to add to my bag of knowledge, but JS is whats going to get me employed"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:35:14.702Z,@whittymakes yeah go through FCC
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:35:34.623Z,"@figitalboy Yea, I'm on the fence of which language to fully focus on.  A programmer I worked with before recommends JS.  Ok JS it is!"
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:36:07.544Z,@odrisck @AmmarAliShah 
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:36:12.800Z,Thanks
odrisck,2015-01-05T19:36:12.852Z,and I suspect you have tons more time than I do :)
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:36:15.385Z,"when you think you've gotten enough under the hood to pick up new stuff easily, then go out exploring languages and by the time you end FCC you'll be ready"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:37:18.451Z,@whittymakes when you try to learn too much too fast: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:37:33.643Z,"btw, it's a great read"
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:38:34.557Z,"FCC also seems to have the most complete learning ""course"" too. Ok, I'll take a look at that article"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:39:08.647Z,Now i'm really going to bed
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:39:13.972Z,bye again!
odrisck,2015-01-05T19:39:25.206Z,sleep well :)
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-05T19:39:59.898Z,thanks @odrisck 
whittymakes,2015-01-05T19:40:26.844Z,@odrisck luckily yes. I've got lot's of time to learn. 
Sincronia,2015-01-05T19:42:39.584Z,"Good evening/morning everyone :) It's been a while since the last time I joined the chat, but I'm keep going on learning. I'm approaching the end of the Try jQuery course."

odrisck,2015-01-05T21:00:57.534Z,"since I'm on the team I do have a bit of a headsup, sure, but you are all able to see anything we do with the trello boards in the right panel > and by peeking over at the trello, which we have made viewable to the public. I know we have a couple of campers who have finished the challenges now, I am not yet aware of whether they've chosen a non profit to work with yet "
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:01:10.869Z,thank you @admhlt 
admhlt,2015-01-05T21:01:25.807Z,:thumbsup: 
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:01:56.470Z,"however, when that has occurred I'm sure you will also be able to see that on the trello :)"
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:02:19.405Z,great! thanks @admhlt 
seahik,2015-01-05T21:02:57.601Z,i had a question about the non-profit site building also..
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:03:11.310Z,"Thanks @odrisck, I’ve been jumping around with different javascript learning and books but keep coming back to FCC because I like the structure of nonprofit projects."
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:03:18.125Z,we receive emails daily from non profits interested in working with our campers
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:03:29.431Z,how can I help you @seahik 
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:03:50.047Z,I'm glad you find it valuable @brndnb :) its why I'm here :)
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:04:07.132Z,"Erm, ""Hello world?"""
seahik,2015-01-05T21:04:08.343Z,Will the site features be somewhat basic.  Nothing involving logins or donation forms for the non-profit?
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:04:19.323Z,I'm new?
benstoltz,2015-01-05T21:04:19.466Z,Welcome @cdvillard :)
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:04:35.668Z,"every non profit is looking for something different, you will be able to choose the project you want to work on, you are not assigned anything without your input"
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:04:46.641Z,welcome to our community @cdvillard 
seahik,2015-01-05T21:04:50.298Z,I wouldnt want to try to create something like that as a novice since I know nothing about security
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:04:52.526Z,Thanks.
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:05:22.532Z,"I have not seen anything involving money, but you can certainly pick and choose for yourself what you want to be involved in"
seahik,2015-01-05T21:05:24.245Z,I've heard horror stories about risks of users login info being compromised.  That login info could be used to access the user email etc if they don't have different passwords.
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:05:35.775Z,I would suggest choosing one that you feel passionate about having involvement in
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:05:51.993Z,"Also, @odrisck I think we must have both come across freecodecamp about the same time going off your previous comment (back when not all of the challenges were finished). But if you’re almost done with everything, you’ve progressed more than I have. Do you find that it has helped to volunteer with the FCC team?"
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:06:07.265Z,"..as in, helped keep you on track with FCC?"
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:06:11.086Z,I appreciate the welcomes. I'm at work doing this so I'll be in and out for a bit. Thank you!
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:06:19.127Z,"I have incredible motivation to try to keep ahead of our campers for sure, otherwise I can't be very helpful :)"
seahik,2015-01-05T21:06:39.353Z,I think its not which kind of non-profit that I would be deciding but more on what features they are looking for in a site
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:07:15.209Z,"but, I'm just like a lot of you all, I'm a noob, I had html and css under my belt, and had done some super basic stuff back when computers were being sold to homes for the first time, I also tinkered around with linux a lot over the years, but this is the first time I've applied myself to actually becoming a programmer"
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:07:27.539Z,thats entirely up to you @seahik 
ESOComputing,2015-01-05T21:07:30.953Z,"@cdvillard  Same here. I'm my sister's nanny, so I'm running around with a 3 year old, trying to study etc. LOL"
seahik,2015-01-05T21:08:01.102Z,is there anyone on the FCC team that can advise on security?
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:08:02.691Z,"Oh, that's me Fridays with my daughter. "
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:08:35.227Z,"yeah we had to carve out a tiny office space in the corner of our bedroom for me, otherwise I have a house full of folks that can't understand that mom/gramma is actually working"
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:08:38.621Z,"I’m a lot more motivated to keep ahead of “students” when I’m actively involved in the help/teaching process. @odrisck, will FCC need any more volunteers in the future?"
admhlt,2015-01-05T21:08:46.940Z,"Some people have loads more time than others. Some days I glance at FCC for a few minutes, others I spend a few hours after work.
I try to always have the chat open though :)"
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:08:59.989Z,"because I'md oing what I've always done, sitting at my laptop curled up on the sofa, they couldn't make the connection, so now I go to my 'office' during 'work' hours :)"
ESOComputing,2015-01-05T21:09:17.678Z,"@odrisck  I know the feeling. I started my own business last year, and my boyfriend just doesn't understand. LOL "
benstoltz,2015-01-05T21:09:40.628Z,I’m so glad my GF programs also...
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:09:47.443Z,"Quincy hasn't placed a cap on the volunteers numbers, we just added one yesterday, please speak with him if you wish to offer yourself up as a sacrifice....I mean offer your services :)"

odrisck,2015-01-05T21:10:12.214Z,;)
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:10:15.359Z,sounds good! thanks!
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:10:18.156Z,"Let me get through a bit more first. I only have HTML, CSS, and some JS and jQuery under my belt."
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:10:20.459Z,certainly :)
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:10:40.676Z,you started with much more under your belt than I did @cdvillard :) I'm glad you found your way here
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:11:17.542Z,"I've been at it on my own for about a year, but after a few small projects, I can't say I've made a ton of progress."
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:11:20.185Z,@ESOComputing what is your business?
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:11:22.902Z,"At least, it doesn't feel like it."
ESOComputing,2015-01-05T21:11:39.992Z,I started repairing computers & doing consulting on Android & PC.

ESOComputing,2015-01-05T21:12:12.527Z,"Steep market though, it's really just for side cash."
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:12:36.097Z,"I'm moving from Freelance Makeup artist to programmer though, I'm concerned about being taken seriously :)"
ESOComputing,2015-01-05T21:12:38.230Z,"I think it's one of those things, you just have to go for and never doubt your own abilities. :)"
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:12:52.260Z,reminds me I have a zero-investment economy book to read up on.

ESOComputing,2015-01-05T21:15:54.129Z,I played with QBasic as a little girl because my grandpa used to right DOS software.

odrisck,2015-01-05T21:16:36.754Z,Hey there is our non profit guy
admhlt,2015-01-05T21:16:37.949Z,I took an intro programming course in university and they taught FORTRAN and C. I don't remember anything from that
ESOComputing,2015-01-05T21:16:45.665Z,@seahik So I'm not alone! ;) @admhlt Good cause I'm a talker (fast-typer too). 
admhlt,2015-01-05T21:17:08.830Z,Has anyone here used Jekyll?
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:17:13.306Z,"I'm an incredible introvert, does it show?"
admhlt,2015-01-05T21:17:21.250Z,Not at all @odrisck :)
odrisck,2015-01-05T21:17:41.916Z,lol
ESOComputing,2015-01-05T21:17:43.741Z,Nope. @admhlt  Not familiar.  @odrisck Couldn't tell.  Me ---> EXTROVERT
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T21:17:46.250Z,@brndnb Feel free to send a private message to @QuincyLarson about volunteer opportunities and how you might be able to contribute
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:17:51.520Z,"admhlt, familiar with the product, not sure how."
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:17:56.570Z,"@admhlt, yes to Jekyll."
Robbertdk,2015-01-05T21:18:32.084Z,"@admhlt Once, for a small project. Just to include headers and footers"
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:18:36.967Z,…and Metalsmith.
admhlt,2015-01-05T21:18:38.687Z,I have a pretty simple WordPress site but I'm thinking maybe Jekyll might be simpler to maintain. It would be a fairly big project and I'm not sure if I should do it.
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:18:54.288Z,I like metalsmith better since it is more flexible and is Javascript.
admhlt,2015-01-05T21:19:32.987Z,"Ooh, that *does* look nice"
cdvillard,2015-01-05T21:19:45.675Z,"Octopress might be a good tool. From what I understand, it's as close to a one-click solution for Jekyl as you may get."
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-05T21:19:48.860Z,"@brndnb @admhlt You guys have a similar naming convention, dropping the vowels"
ESOComputing,2015-01-05T21:19:53.367Z,I used to code all my sites with Notepad... my friend who went to design school tried to get me into Wordpress... I'm still not interested. I just like to write my own designs on paper and then convert to code. 
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:19:58.142Z,I’ve been using Jekyll for the past two years for a fermentation podcast/blog and it works great. You can check it out here if you want to see a slightly more complex (not just a blog) setup of Jekyll: http://fermup.com

brandenbyers,2015-01-05T21:21:04.787Z,@figitalboy Ha! Good catch. I drop the vowels because some people get confused by the spelling of my first name: Branden. Some think it is “Brendan” others mispell it as “Brandon” so it is just easier to drop ‘em.

faiyzuddin,2015-01-05T22:08:49.914Z,hello i am new user of free code camp! and i am at beginners level of programming
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:08:50.643Z, :)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:08:54.997Z,I haven't really done much at all today really lol
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:09:02.569Z,@faiyzuddin welcome!
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:09:03.440Z,Welcome @faiyzuddin  Glad to have you.
deamme,2015-01-05T22:09:04.857Z,@faiyzuddin Welcome :-)
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:09:17.663Z,I have to this is my escape plan from this current life.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:09:24.627Z,I did just change some lightbulbs and take out the trash though
faiyzuddin,2015-01-05T22:09:39.809Z,thanks to all for reply! i want to ask what can i do next?
benstoltz,2015-01-05T22:09:42.187Z,"Holy be-jebus….I’m not cooking for ages apparently. Just walked out to the kitchen entirely flooded right onto the stove….Apparently someone upstairs left the toilet running while clogged and it leaked down through the ceiling, through the lights, and then down onto the entirety of the kitchen."
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:09:47.398Z,lol
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:09:58.991Z,nasty
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:10:01.700Z,Oh damn Ben
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:10:16.577Z,@benstoltz That sucks!
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:10:25.922Z,"Sorry that happened, man."
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:10:36.691Z,"@faiyzuddin welcome to the community, the next step is to get to work on the challenges my friend :)"
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:10:48.074Z,ok really going this time
benstoltz,2015-01-05T22:10:50.676Z,I’m just hoping it didn’t ruin the stove…it’s an electric which is now swimming in water…..
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:10:58.125Z,@iheartkode do you have the free or premium version of rescue time?
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:11:26.310Z,free
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:11:54.537Z,Can we code an Android port of EpicWin? I'm dying here.
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:12:27.693Z,"Heh, right, I'm new, and this isn't my regular chat. Sorry. ^^;;"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:13:21.276Z,We are a JavaScript course :) 
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:13:36.160Z,You can make android apps with JS with phonegapp :)
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:13:58.452Z,Hmmm...
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:14:14.236Z,or cordova or ionic
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:15:04.048Z,"+1 for Ionic. They’re right here in Madison, WI."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:16:15.647Z,awesome!
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:16:21.128Z,I'm in Minneapolis :)
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:17:11.648Z,@sircharleswatson I lived in Minneapolis 10 years ago. How’s the coding community there?
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:17:28.238Z,Might go chug some water in a bit. Or coffee.
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:17:30.811Z,I like coffee.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:17:54.802Z,It's decent. Most jobs are Ruby/Rails unfortunately
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:18:07.727Z,the good ones at least :P
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:18:26.423Z,Ruby <3
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:19:01.376Z,"Yes, same here. I tried getting into rails a couple of years ago but it never quite felt right for my tastes. I should have started with Javascript, but at least I’m giving it a go now."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:19:11.298Z,Ruby :fire: > :deciduous_tree: 
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:19:40.811Z,"@brndnb Same. Started with ruby, then Objective-C/iOS, and now JS"
cshutchinson,2015-01-05T22:20:16.709Z,what a crazy day....can't wait to get home and write some code!!!!
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:20:25.220Z,Do you have a preference? Are you a working dev?
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:21:03.662Z,I am a lover of Ruby and JS
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:21:16.537Z,I was working with iOS for about a year. then got laid off because of company finances dwindling.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:21:28.668Z,then started studying JS full-time
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:21:41.290Z,and now I'm here :)
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:21:54.350Z,"@iheartkode does that mean you lean more towards Ember than Angular, React, or Backbone?"
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:22:20.291Z,My goal is MEAN Stack  
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:22:30.246Z,ExpressJS Angular
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:22:35.353Z,My goal is Meteor :)
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:22:36.040Z,Node and Mongo
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:23:15.183Z,Ok. It just seems a lot of rails people like Ember’s rails-i-ness.
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:24:43.150Z,Yes
iheartkode,2015-01-05T22:24:53.516Z,Rails is ember and backbone
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:25:00.218Z,@sircharleswatson have you checked out the Meteor learning group  (started in December) from Javascriptissexy? http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-meteor-js-properly/
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:25:25.384Z,"@brndnb Yes, I have looked at it, but i am not following that course"
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:26:06.311Z,"I started out on it, but I’m not sure if meteor.js is the way I want to go at the moment."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:26:28.209Z,no worries. It is a different way of thinking
benstoltz,2015-01-05T22:26:35.625Z,"https://www.discovermeteor.com is a great resource @sircharleswatson, if you haven’t found it already"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:26:38.503Z,I feel like it fits me though
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:26:48.567Z,@benstoltz I have already read it and the bonus content :) 
benstoltz,2015-01-05T22:26:57.544Z,Excllent :D
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:27:27.388Z,@benstoltz @brndnb I am about half-way through this list: https://github.com/ericdouglas/Meteor-Learning
benstoltz,2015-01-05T22:27:54.120Z,oh nice
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:28:32.194Z,That is a nice list. I’ve added it to my reading list if/when I go back to Meteor. Thanks!
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:28:40.301Z,no problem :)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:29:15.283Z,"@brndnb, @iheartkode likes Meteor too but he doesn't like to admit it ;) "
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:29:23.313Z,Does Newsweek realize how easy it is to clone their website?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:29:40.322Z,@cdvillard you can do that with any website
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:30:21.575Z,"Yeah, but I've never seen it as complete as I have with the NewsWeek site. You usually can just copy the HTML, not the CSS and JS with it."
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:30:30.512Z,http://codepen.io/pen/
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:30:34.118Z,Have you checked out Mithril.js? I’m really liking what I’m learning from that so far.
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:30:34.303Z,"Wait, damn."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:30:57.187Z,"@brndnb Mithril, sounds medieval"
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:31:03.356Z,http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GgNwRx
brandenbyers,2015-01-05T22:31:11.546Z,"Yes, I’m pretty sure it’s Tolkein inspired."
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:31:51.791Z,"@sircharleswatson Versus, say @iheartkode's site."
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:31:51.881Z,HAH got my weather app working in F
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:31:58.623Z,It's a security thing.
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:32:06.176Z,scuse me while I dance around then go load the thing up so you can all admire my ruby skillz
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:34:07.611Z,@cdvillard they might have some css/js linked in their head tag. but whatever you see on any site is public so it is easy to duplicate. even on @iheartkode 's site
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:36:22.394Z,"It looks like they have everything pasted into the one HTML file. I'm just saying, someone can clone it and scam people."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:37:38.198Z,theoretically yes
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:46:05.695Z,erm whats the place that will host apps? I am having a blank moment
benstoltz,2015-01-05T22:46:22.252Z,:P pray narrow it down to type of apps?
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:46:31.088Z,a ruby app
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:46:43.579Z,heroku
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:46:46.434Z,"we talk about it all the time, YESSS"
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:46:48.211Z,ty charles :)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:46:58.112Z,no problem ;) That's what i'm here for
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:47:12.921Z,such a helper :)
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:47:37.012Z,"I'm just so glad, it was a stupid thing, I'd finished the app but I couldn't find how to change it from celcius"
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:47:39.004Z,found it :)
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:48:12.595Z,so I'm going back and reloading it to skillcrush and then putting it on heroku cuz I'm so proud of it lol
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:48:43.819Z,I think its in a repo too I'll have to push it
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:50:36.788Z,@odrisck That you on the Programs page on SkillCrush? :P
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:51:35.704Z,I'm on skillcrush yes
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:52:13.961Z,lol
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:53:13.665Z,"I mean the picture on the website, because she looks kinda like you . . . in your profile pic . . ."
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:53:19.498Z,oh
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:53:21.840Z,uhm
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:53:22.778Z, . . . I'll just pick up that joke that fell flat. 
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:53:33.278Z,I don't think I gave them my picture
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:54:16.114Z,http://skillcrush.com/skillcrush-blueprints/
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:54:19.693Z,I use my real name on the mightybell though
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:54:33.699Z,"hehe no not me, but I'm flattered :)"
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:54:48.730Z,"when FCC talks about the grandma learning to code, thats me :)"
cdvillard,2015-01-05T22:55:39.669Z,"XD Always nice to be recognized, though."
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:56:13.432Z,oh yeah I'm proud to say the article I wrote for FCC brought a few people over :)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T22:58:07.448Z,@odrisck Are you done with SkillCrush yet? 
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:58:38.723Z,"I'm technically done, the three months ended, but I left a few things dangling, I have to finish the twillio app "
odrisck,2015-01-05T22:58:50.922Z,and this email sign up page thats giving me migraines :)
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:00:24.674Z,"I did web dev blueprint, and this final project for the html css course is something they didn't go through with us, here is a psd file, now make it a web page, so I've had to go teach myself how to export layers into image files, and then go back and redo some of them because it didn't export them right, so I've spent probably three days on it"
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:01:03.822Z,"its all together now, I'm just working on the details like getting the shadows right, making the @fontface thingy work"
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:01:18.757Z,so it should be done tomorrow
Maximization,2015-01-05T23:01:37.194Z,"hmm, liked the story of the owner though"
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:02:28.565Z,…….and the water in the ceiling has moved into my bathroom
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:02:36.624Z,Must…preserve….my bed…..
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:02:50.736Z,"oh no, are you in a condo/apartment ???"
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:03:26.356Z,house
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:03:33.438Z,uhoh
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:03:39.916Z,I rent a room from a family
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:03:54.753Z,oh well thats good you don't have to cover the roof repairs
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:04:13.864Z,For sure. Unfortunately the entire kitchen is no unusable for several days
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:04:16.986Z,now*
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:04:20.476Z,your bed should be covered under their homeowners insurance? maybe? or do you have renters insurance?
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:04:39.293Z,Well the bed is safe for now. All their kitchen appliances unfortunately…..
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:04:48.798Z,damn
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:04:58.504Z,are you getting reimbursed for the lack of a kitchen?
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:05:19.417Z,"If I asked probably, but that’s not a big deal. "
Maximization,2015-01-05T23:05:55.679Z,pizza's to the rescue!
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:06:01.184Z,hahaha
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:06:12.150Z,It’s poop/pee water though… /shudders
piecedigital,2015-01-05T23:06:27.388Z,5... 5 dollar... 5 dollar footloooooong!
piecedigital,2015-01-05T23:06:39.931Z,"Oh, hi. What's up everyone?"
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:07:09.649Z,lol
Maximization,2015-01-05T23:07:26.510Z,"oh the smell.. it's starting to crowd the chatroom, run y'all!"
cdvillard,2015-01-05T23:09:13.291Z,Ooh lord!
cdvillard,2015-01-05T23:09:33.219Z,Have they cut the tap?
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:09:49.061Z,Yeah that’s fixed up tg
cdvillard,2015-01-05T23:10:57.145Z,Sorry you're in that situation.
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:11:02.822Z,It’s life.
cdvillard,2015-01-05T23:11:10.431Z,Best of luck with it though.
cdvillard,2015-01-05T23:11:19.754Z,"i've gotta get going, but it's been great meeting you alL!"
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:11:23.527Z,At least I’m not financially liable.
cdvillard,2015-01-05T23:11:33.885Z,Truth.
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:11:35.987Z,"Peace @cdvillard, have a good evening"
cdvillard,2015-01-05T23:11:42.071Z,You too.
trisell,2015-01-05T23:15:11.171Z,I suck and front-end dev...that's all there is to that..
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:15:34.237Z,Not true @trisell.  How long have you been doing front-end dev?
trisell,2015-01-05T23:15:56.954Z,I've dabbled....
trisell,2015-01-05T23:16:10.881Z,I just have a hard time being artsy and making it look pretty.
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:16:14.663Z,How can you be good yet at any skill that you’ve only dabbled in?
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:16:23.983Z,It comes with practice and time.
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:17:21.318Z,"Try sketching out ideas on paper first. Once you have a concept firmly in mind and on paper, so you can see it, then start coding it up. If you’re just coding a concept in your head it won’t come together as a polished ‘pretty’ thing."
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:17:30.615Z,You’re mind will change and alter things as you code.
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:17:34.935Z,sucking at design isn't the same as sucking at development
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:17:44.726Z,That too.
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:17:45.776Z,@odrisck knows
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:18:05.837Z,So be patient with yourself and give yourself time.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T23:18:50.489Z,@iheartkode This was made with meteor: http://yesyesyall.org/
benstoltz,2015-01-05T23:19:14.472Z,Very purple.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T23:20:00.323Z,the background changes colors
trisell,2015-01-05T23:20:56.747Z,"Yeah. I'm just going through all this design stuff...not my thing....at.....alll......
"
Maximization,2015-01-05T23:22:13.272Z,"I suck at design too, I'm too perfectionistic when it comes to alignment and take way too much time"
trisell,2015-01-05T23:25:30.140Z,My issues is that I can't think of a good design. Just give me what you want. I make it happen...Pulling an awesome design out of my ass.....nope...not gonna happen...
Maximization,2015-01-05T23:25:31.728Z,"design is also way more subjective than coding, which can give you keep you going forever if you have troubles defining a project as done"
jmcshane,2015-01-05T23:25:44.982Z,Nice to see that I was joined by 8 other people crossing the 20 challenges mark yesterday
Maximization,2015-01-05T23:25:47.685Z,"coding is analogous, it either works or it doesn't"
jmcshane,2015-01-05T23:25:52.447Z,way to go everybody!
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T23:26:06.077Z,I definitely don't particularly enjoy front-end dev either (including design)
Maximization,2015-01-05T23:26:29.760Z,"@trisell you don't have to reinvent the wheel, try replicating good designs that are already out there"
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:31:26.360Z,"ok here is my design trick, I follow a lot of designers, I look at sites like hack design and dribble, I find some designs I like, I replicate them, make the changes I need, and pocket the html and css for future use, here is the deal though, you need to keep your finger on the pulse of where design is going, its something you need to watch all the time, things change, what people like changes"
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:31:58.352Z,I pay attention to whats out there for what I'm doing
marektro,2015-01-05T23:35:05.162Z,Hello everyone :) I'm new here but really excited about this challanges. Hope we'll make something useful together

teddy-error,2015-01-05T23:41:29.937Z,@sircharleswatson  what is it?
mikeelliott,2015-01-05T23:47:00.854Z,@odrisck That's the best design advice I've heard in awhile
sircharleswatson,2015-01-05T23:54:03.562Z,@teddy-error What is what?
odrisck,2015-01-05T23:59:45.616Z,Thanks @mikeelliott :)
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T00:31:44.450Z,Looks like things quieted down in here since earlier today. But I'm back for a bit. Finally ready to really get started. LOL (Being self-employed often means that things come up and you don't have time to study. Or you have to get it in when and where you can!)
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T00:32:02.393Z,Hello to all who are present. :)
mikeelliott,2015-01-06T00:33:37.122Z,"Hello @ESOComputing - I know the feeling, self-employed as well with  2 kids in elementary school so I squeeze in lessons whenever I can but shoot for at least 2-3 hours a day. Seeing everybody plugging away in here keeps me motivated."
BenClist,2015-01-06T00:33:48.757Z,"Hi @ESOComputing . I know about getting it in when you can, currently sat on here doing Coder Byte challenges as there's no proper work to do!"
BenClist,2015-01-06T00:34:01.303Z,whilst at work I should say :)
brandenbyers,2015-01-06T00:37:54.510Z,Just popping in to say I'm currently listening to the latest episode of the Start Here podcast and within the first few minutes they mentioned FCC. You can listen here if you're not already: http://starthere.fm
brandenbyers,2015-01-06T00:38:30.277Z,"...ok, and now back to making dinner for the family."
cshutchinson,2015-01-06T00:39:31.138Z,@brndnb just finished the dishes... now on to some FCC goodness !
mikeelliott,2015-01-06T00:41:33.712Z,"@brndnb thanks for that link, hadn't heard of that podcast before, checking it out now."
BenClist,2015-01-06T00:42:58.936Z,"interesting to see the different time zones people are in, talking about cooking dinner and doing the dishes whilst I'm sat at work in the early afternoon"
Maximization,2015-01-06T00:43:07.839Z,@seahik you're 2nd of Sweden! hats off
seahik,2015-01-06T00:44:03.520Z,hahaha  i think i was number one a few weeks ago
seahik,2015-01-06T00:44:46.790Z,i should go back on there i did a spurt and then quit when i found FCC
Maximization,2015-01-06T00:45:46.108Z,"main diff between coderbyte and codeabbey is that instead of just giving you a problem to solve codeabbey first guides you into it, this way you have an idea of what approach you should take"
Maximization,2015-01-06T00:45:59.218Z,you also learn quite a bit from the problem descriptions
Maximization,2015-01-06T00:46:33.774Z,"same here, I'm doing coderbyte only because it's in the challenges"
seahik,2015-01-06T00:47:46.991Z,yes its a great little site
seahik,2015-01-06T00:48:00.485Z,charming in fact
seahik,2015-01-06T00:48:14.172Z,in my opinion
seahik,2015-01-06T00:48:31.025Z,coderbyte..on the other hand...frustrates me
seahik,2015-01-06T00:48:49.617Z,i got stuck right off the bat i think on the 2nd challenge
seahik,2015-01-06T00:49:25.381Z,"and i can't debug very easily in the console, so i write the code elsewhere and then come back and paste it in"
odrisck,2015-01-06T00:49:34.694Z,yeah I've set aside coderbyte to the last :)
Maximization,2015-01-06T00:49:43.905Z,"oh yes, the easiest of them all, it makes you feel as if you don't know anything anymore"
seahik,2015-01-06T00:49:54.725Z,"and then when i go to submit it, a lot of times it freezes with the CB logo spinning"
iheartkode,2015-01-06T00:49:55.235Z,^
Maximization,2015-01-06T00:51:11.882Z,@odrisck @iheartkode who should I contact to get started with a project for non-profit?
seahik,2015-01-06T00:51:13.369Z,maybe we should create a coderbyte tutorial for the harder ones
Maximization,2015-01-06T00:51:55.897Z,the screencasts can be helpful
Maximization,2015-01-06T00:52:04.348Z,just need more of them
benstoltz,2015-01-06T00:52:42.092Z,How are folks doing?
odrisck,2015-01-06T00:52:47.157Z,contact @QuincyLarson or @figitalboy 
seahik,2015-01-06T00:53:18.560Z,i think ive finished 15 of the CB challenges.  Is there 60 total?
odrisck,2015-01-06T00:53:27.043Z,I think so yes
seahik,2015-01-06T00:53:59.657Z,hey ya Ben.  I read about your damp issues :S my condolences
MychaelZ,2015-01-06T00:54:03.550Z,81 if u count the hards

seahik,2015-01-06T00:54:47.633Z,ah ok good to hear
seahik,2015-01-06T00:55:21.305Z,"well hopefully by the time im through with Eloquent JS and the first 60, I'll have a better handle"
benstoltz,2015-01-06T00:58:54.331Z,Thanks @seahik. WEll there will be a new ceiling in the kitchen at least?
seahik,2015-01-06T00:59:43.980Z,ha way to look for the positive.....who doesnt appreciate a new kitchen ceiling??
Maximization,2015-01-06T01:00:28.552Z,"alright, it's 2am here off to bed"
Maximization,2015-01-06T01:00:33.099Z,good night everyone
seahik,2015-01-06T01:00:35.820Z,hope your property didn't get damaged?  did your landlords have insurance?
seahik,2015-01-06T01:00:43.194Z,night maxim!
seahik,2015-01-06T01:01:36.455Z,ah same time here.. i should crash also
benstoltz,2015-01-06T01:02:11.751Z,Oh they have insurance. I don’t have to pay anything TG
benstoltz,2015-01-06T01:02:25.349Z,I think they’re going to try to get a new stove out of this too
seahik,2015-01-06T01:02:35.330Z,ah good to hear
seahik,2015-01-06T01:05:07.584Z,ok im out too...g'night!
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:12:25.767Z,How is everyones evenings going?
cshutchinson,2015-01-06T02:12:48.924Z,"great, hope yours is as well"
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:16:17.998Z,"good, how about you @benstoltz "
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:17:07.967Z,Ehhhh….the horrible toilet overflowing incident upstairs has turned into having to tear out three floors upstairs and three ceiling downstairs and two floors downstairs.
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:17:25.085Z,And it’s allllll going on now. So….no productivity possible and horrid headache
cshutchinson,2015-01-06T02:18:23.654Z,really sorry to hear that Ben; those problems tend to stick around for a while
cshutchinson,2015-01-06T02:19:38.410Z,"we have a spare room, but its a long commute for you....I used to do it twice a day :)"
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:20:17.923Z,haha
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:23:18.838Z,"Yeah, I’m glad we are getting it dealt with now. Mold from dirty toilet water in the walls and ceilings and floors is not a good thought"
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:23:33.947Z,"omgsh, this time of night?"
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:23:41.056Z,Yes from now till 12pm
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:23:52.847Z,lucky you?
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:24:21.245Z,we should take up a collection to get you some noise canceling headphones
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:24:27.315Z,"Turns out the upstairs bathroom, instead of putting a floating floor layer over the underfloor and then putting laminate on top the original contractors glued the laminate directly to the subfloor…."
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:24:40.884Z,oh no
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:24:46.337Z,Meaning like 2 - 3 hours of hammering to get it up.
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:25:43.241Z,thats horrible
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:25:55.866Z,"@benstoltz Sorry to hear of all that... total bummer. But so true, better than having poopy water molding in the walls etc."
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:26:03.746Z,So gross... :(
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:26:09.251Z,Yeahhhhhh
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:26:21.269Z,Ok so I have a question....
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:26:31.934Z,ask away
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:26:32.376Z,Going to have to bleach the heck out of the stove….since it leaked through the ceiling and inundated the stove
drewsky2010,2015-01-06T02:26:59.684Z,hello world

cshutchinson,2015-01-06T02:27:57.281Z,@benstoltz  at least your internet connection still works :)
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:28:09.189Z,Oh thank god yes
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:28:15.572Z,lol
benstoltz,2015-01-06T02:29:39.309Z,@ESOComputing You had a question?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:29:44.785Z,"I only recently started transitioning to using HTML5, I had previously used XHTML for my websites, I'm doing the first lesson here on code camp with code... and in building ""Anna's"" website I noticed it doesn't have you put a space/ before >..."
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:30:03.665Z,so do we omit the self-closing brackets now on void tags?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:30:34.881Z,I had still been doing the space/> on my sites
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:30:44.602Z,ex <br />
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:31:04.553Z,"some things, like <br> do not need that now, correct"
jmcshane,2015-01-06T02:31:27.239Z,<br /> is still valid though
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:31:40.051Z,"yes its still valid, won't break your code, just unecessary"
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:31:44.373Z,"Previously, the /> had to do with mobile browsers, should we still include it?"
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:31:55.136Z,"not necessary, nope"
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:32:14.755Z,OK. I still have to do backwards compatibility for some client's I'm just wondering how far back I really have to go. 
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:32:33.631Z,you aren't going to hurt anything to continue the practice

towwiow,2015-01-06T02:32:58.284Z,what's the topic?
towwiow,2015-01-06T02:33:03.636Z,hi everyone!
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:33:19.219Z,the topic is whatever you want it to be :)
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:33:23.453Z,hi there @towwiow 
cshutchinson,2015-01-06T02:33:24.016Z,hi @towwiow  :)

towwiow,2015-01-06T02:33:30.646Z,that's always fancy
towwiow,2015-01-06T02:33:35.136Z,hi everyone!
towwiow,2015-01-06T02:34:10.956Z,"okay. I think I'm going to zombie until all the files are moved from my second laptop and I either a, put ubuntu on it entirely or put a new windows 7 on it entirely"

BitTinker,2015-01-06T02:34:46.153Z,Evening everybody!
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:34:52.515Z,Hi there @BitTinker 
towwiow,2015-01-06T02:34:58.111Z,@odrisck yeah for sure
towwiow,2015-01-06T02:35:06.045Z,I downloaded the iso and transferred it to the usb
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:35:09.293Z,Because of my main business client I have to have Windows (I wish I could strictly run Linux). I need to get around to putting it on this laptop. 
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:35:11.377Z,sweet
towwiow,2015-01-06T02:35:14.338Z,but when I went to boot from the usb it said I had a faulty file
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:35:32.541Z,one day when our income is steady again I'm going to get that linux box built :)
towwiow,2015-01-06T02:35:34.590Z,I was puzzled by it because it seemed to do everything right..
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:35:35.603Z,I'm itching
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:35:45.519Z,ginormous monitor
BitTinker,2015-01-06T02:35:45.883Z,Currently redoing the CodeSchool jquery stuff because I think I outran myself a little
towwiow,2015-01-06T02:35:48.196Z,linux box?
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:36:05.335Z,"and my laptop will once again be for gaming, twitter, fb and pinterest :)"
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:36:21.099Z,yeah
BitTinker,2015-01-06T02:36:31.177Z,"does anyone know whether its ""best practice"" to use either single or double quotes in jQuery? I know that either ""work,"" just wondering if there is an established preference for readability or whatever."
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:36:47.110Z,I've spec'd out a computer I'm going to build for linux to dev on
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:36:57.032Z,"with linux, not for :)"
odrisck,2015-01-06T02:37:00.930Z,I can english
jmcshane,2015-01-06T02:37:34.710Z,"@BitTinker One thing to keep in mind is if you want to include ' in your string, you can use "" "", and if you want to include "" in your string you can use '. These can also be escaped, so it doesn't make a big difference"
BitTinker,2015-01-06T02:37:47.015Z,Ok that makes sense
BitTinker,2015-01-06T02:37:54.871Z,Thanks a lit!
BitTinker,2015-01-06T02:37:57.499Z,*lot
jmcshane,2015-01-06T02:38:19.121Z,"actually, I think I spoke too soon"
jmcshane,2015-01-06T02:38:24.697Z,http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/#quotes says use double quotes always
jmcshane,2015-01-06T02:38:43.210Z,Theres a little more discussion on the topic here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7027986/single-or-double-quotes-in-jquery
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:38:52.954Z,I use double quotes myself because sometimes I want single quotes within strings... 
BitTinker,2015-01-06T02:39:40.370Z,"Ahh, to be sure, that irons it out. Haha I had actually found that StackExchange answer and it still left me confused so thanks for fixing it!!"
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:39:44.218Z,Technically either are acceptable and I notice many developers using single quotes though because it loads faster. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T02:40:48.906Z,"I am kinda oldskool with my idea of how code should be written, maintaining strict conventions and proper commenting. :) Good practices to be in the habit of. "

odrisck,2015-01-06T03:24:06.883Z,I see no reason it shouldnt work unless you have made an error in the class name
odrisck,2015-01-06T03:24:24.216Z,is it Landcape or Landscapes
JessiW,2015-01-06T03:24:24.629Z,okay - I'll look
BenClist,2015-01-06T03:24:48.939Z,"make sure it's a class and not an id, that's quite a common mistake"
JessiW,2015-01-06T03:25:11.430Z,here's what I've got for the landscape class
JessiW,2015-01-06T03:25:16.757Z,"<div class=""Landscape"">"
odrisck,2015-01-06T03:25:27.538Z,there is your error

jleia1976,2015-01-06T03:48:12.340Z,Friend who knew I was interested in learning to code sent me the recent blog about FCC being open source.
robcolella,2015-01-06T03:48:16.455Z,Is there any plan to incorporate css pre-processors into the curriculum in the future?

towwiow,2015-01-06T04:52:02.724Z,hi @ItTastesLikeBurning 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T04:52:12.820Z,Good Morning!
FrankMTL,2015-01-06T04:52:33.333Z,Thanks Dominic!
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T04:52:37.678Z,@ItTastesLikeBurning Welcome to FCC! How did you fond out about us?
towwiow,2015-01-06T04:52:41.309Z,You're welcome.
towwiow,2015-01-06T04:53:25.297Z,"Yup, @FrankMTL How did you find out about us? We always like to know how new campers trickle on in through the bush, and get close to the fire. hehe"
towwiow,2015-01-06T04:55:06.663Z,@cameronchong - you're doing the small biz site - what section are you in?
sparklingyoyotu,2015-01-06T04:55:40.198Z,"i just start learning HTML,and i was wondering what's the function of tag<div>.Why placing more than one？"
towwiow,2015-01-06T04:56:37.282Z,@sparklingyoyotu it helps you keep your code organized and it is the most multi-functional attribute known to HTML. You can do a lot of things with it (in laymen's terms)
cameronchong,2015-01-06T04:57:03.020Z,"@towwiow The last stage, build your own"
makeitbetter,2015-01-06T04:57:12.802Z,You can specify different styles for each div would be one example I think.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T04:58:07.003Z,@sparklingyoyotu ```<div>``` means division. It's used to divide your page into different sections. Later on when you'll use CSS you'll understamd the importance of div's in styling specific areas of the website
FrankMTL,2015-01-06T04:58:23.271Z,"Over the last month, I decided to learn some code and I really enjoyed it. So I went on google and researched how I can learn the skills to have a career in programming. I came across tons of bootcamps charging lots of money for intense classes.  That wasn't in my budget so I researched some more and I came across this amazing site. So very grateful that I found it!"

towwiow,2015-01-06T05:01:09.219Z,@cameronchong - yes it does. So you're saying that the black bar where the food descriptions go all the way across the image is the issue right?
odrisck,2015-01-06T05:01:44.061Z,google is your friend :)

towwiow,2015-01-06T05:02:39.827Z,@cameronchong - when I came up against this issue... I had to add more text and it stretched it out.
FrankMTL,2015-01-06T05:02:48.935Z,@towwiow @odrisck Thank u :smile: 
odrisck,2015-01-06T05:03:01.440Z,:wave:
cameronchong,2015-01-06T05:03:25.510Z,"@towwiow Wow, why didn't I think of that *facepalm*"
towwiow,2015-01-06T05:03:27.338Z,"@cameronchong - your second one has enough text in it to wrap to the second line. the first and last one do not. When I encountered it, adding more text is what got mine to stay."
cameronchong,2015-01-06T05:03:29.967Z,Thank you
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T05:03:33.705Z,@FrankMTL did you start with the challenges?
towwiow,2015-01-06T05:03:41.516Z,@cameronchong - you're welcome buddy :) 
FrankMTL,2015-01-06T05:04:11.504Z,"@AmmarAliShah Yes, I;m doing them now"
cameronchong,2015-01-06T05:04:15.010Z,"Thank you for the explanation as well, always awesome to know not only how to fix something but why the fix works :D"
towwiow,2015-01-06T05:04:45.507Z,"@cameronchong that's why I'm going to become a teacher soon :) I feel the same way haha. how and why are essential, "
towwiow,2015-01-06T05:05:02.734Z,but somethings you can't even explain the why you just know the how lol
jbcruz0209,2015-01-06T05:05:21.536Z,"Hello everyone, I just joined FreeCodeCamp! I looking forward to the chats in this room. "
towwiow,2015-01-06T05:05:36.211Z,@jbcruz0209 welcome to FreeCodeCamp! 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T05:05:36.348Z,@FrankMTL that's great! if you face any problem just come here for help :smile: 
cameronchong,2015-01-06T05:05:43.325Z,"@towwiow Yeah that is true, but if you know the why its always helpful"

crosscris,2015-01-06T05:07:14.764Z,@jbcruz0209 Welcome to FCC
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T05:07:24.210Z,I'll be back after a short laptop reboott
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T05:07:28.573Z,reboot*
FrankMTL,2015-01-06T05:07:56.111Z,@AmmarAliShah Thank u! :smile: 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T05:08:04.337Z,So glad I decided to go over all of the lessons on here even though I already am fluent in HTML & CSS. I haven't yet worked with responsive designs and now I totally get media queries. :)
BenClist,2015-01-06T05:08:59.697Z,@cameronchong you can solve your problem properly by setting a width: 100% on your paragraph
BenClist,2015-01-06T05:09:10.947Z,@cameronchong it won't matter about the amount of text then
BenClist,2015-01-06T05:09:28.805Z,the p tag will expand to the width of it's parent (the div with the picture)
cameronchong,2015-01-06T05:09:29.980Z,"@BenClist Awesome, I will try that now"
BenClist,2015-01-06T05:10:20.180Z,I think it looks better the way it is in the top and bottom one though tbh
cameronchong,2015-01-06T05:10:51.806Z,"@BenClist That didn't work, doing it with 100% width makes it wider than the picture, on the right"
cameronchong,2015-01-06T05:14:32.547Z,@BenClist I also prefer it not 100% looks wise but I was just aiming to replicate the styling from dash before I played around with it
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T05:15:27.670Z,@ESOComputing same was the case with me :smile: 
BenClist,2015-01-06T05:15:47.678Z,@cameronchong  add padding-left: 0; to the p tag as well sorry
cameronchong,2015-01-06T05:17:33.568Z,Well it fits now but the text needs padding on the left 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T05:21:58.011Z,@AmmarAliShah :)
jbcruz0209,2015-01-06T05:29:24.190Z,Thanks fellow coders
cameronchong,2015-01-06T05:34:15.404Z,Thanks @BenClist :)

tsaifoon,2015-01-06T05:41:46.576Z,I just found this website through my cousin who sent me an article.  I am excited to learn because I have always wanted to make my own app!  Please be patient with me!  I will work my hardest to do well!  
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T05:42:53.593Z,@tsaifoon welcome to FCC!

tsaifoon,2015-01-06T05:55:36.414Z,@AmmarAliShah Way ahead of you! ^^
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T05:56:11.253Z,@tsaifoon that's good. Which challenge are you on?
tsaifoon,2015-01-06T05:57:23.384Z,"@AmmarAliShah Just got to challenge 3, not that far in haha."
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T05:57:51.098Z,@tsaifoon no problem you'll get it done :+1: 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T05:57:56.108Z,OH yeah... i just was off in dash working on the lesson simulating the process of building a small business site.
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T05:58:22.309Z,@benstoltz 
benstoltz,2015-01-06T05:58:25.444Z,@ESOComputing Earlier you teased us with what music types you listen to without saying any bands!
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T05:58:39.893Z,LOL
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T05:59:16.928Z,"Sorry. During the day I am my nephew's nanny... he's the priority. I got distracted, then my sis came home from work early and I didn't get back on till I got home... "
benstoltz,2015-01-06T05:59:41.657Z,"oh it’s fine, just being silly"
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T05:59:44.319Z,well I must admit since I moved back to the Bay I don't listen to much new rock... there are no decent stations here in my opinion. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T05:59:51.291Z,I miss ZRock up in Chico.... 
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:00:16.086Z,well let’s go with the old/semi old rock
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:00:23.136Z,"Anyway, I like all sorts of stuff so it's more a question of what I won't listen to. "
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:00:40.678Z,clutch / Type O?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:00:58.559Z,Black Black No 1 
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:01:06.438Z,<3
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:01:13.758Z,Clutch?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:01:25.217Z,Never really listened to them.
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:01:28.201Z,I’ve been surprised at how little people know of them
StevenKW,2015-01-06T06:01:42.975Z,are you guys making up fictions band names?
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:01:45.701Z,@benstoltz what type of music?

mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:02:14.130Z,super! i'll have to check them out. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:02:24.549Z,I'm watching a movie with my boyfriend right now... I'll have to check em out later
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:02:37.945Z,@ESOComputing what movie?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:02:44.070Z,For A Good Time Call
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:02:52.430Z,how u like it so far?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:03:00.433Z,"dunno, we just started it lol"
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:03:05.223Z,lol
StevenKW,2015-01-06T06:03:06.606Z,"no chatting during the movie :)
"
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:03:14.268Z,we'll be expecting a movie review soonest
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:03:30.988Z,LOL. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:05:09.768Z,"Only half-way paying attention to the movie and the room honestly, cause I'm pushing thru the challenges here. "
jordanw,2015-01-06T06:05:23.379Z,Clutch ftw
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:05:36.917Z,So good.
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:05:39.087Z,@ESOComputing WOW on the multi-tasking. I cannot do that with chat - 
jordanw,2015-01-06T06:05:52.328Z,Just saw them fro the third time in concert.
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:05:57.549Z,I used to be an uber nerd when I was a kid and was on the computer all the time... 
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:05:57.628Z,@ESOComputing What challenge are you on currently?
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:06:00.047Z,Jealous man...
jordanw,2015-01-06T06:06:35.143Z,Perfect set. Even busted out the acoustic for gone cold.
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:06:59.615Z,I'm about to start 6. So far it's mostly review of concepts I already know. I just haven't worked with responsive mobile designs much yet. 
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:06:59.684Z,"Yeah, I’ve heard that they are exceptional live band"
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:07:32.939Z,You guys are welcome to check out the small business site I've been in charge of for the past 7 years. www.buzzstrong.com
jordanw,2015-01-06T06:08:23.003Z,Definitely. Neil Fallon is the man.
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:09:08.632Z,"The last major concert I went to was years ago, Dimmu borgir, Nevermore, CHildren of bodom"
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:09:17.762Z,They manufacture natural cookies. The original concept was a cookie with the equivalent of one cup of coffee. Then they started doing cookies for schools that fit the new strict health guidelines across the country (don't have coffee in them). 
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:10:01.024Z,"hah, and King diamond. That was a weird show."
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T06:10:10.175Z,@ESOComputing cool website. Did you build it too?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:10:15.597Z,From scratch. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:10:17.640Z,Yup.
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:10:29.340Z,Just rewrote it to update to HTML5 last month. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:10:53.253Z,"It's a static site for the most part, but I have to update little things here and there all the time. I use PHP as well. "
odrisck,2015-01-06T06:11:24.865Z,oh cool imageflow and highslide
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T06:11:31.130Z,@ESOComputing that's great :smile: 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:11:45.323Z,"Yeah, I found them a few years back. Love those scripts."
jordanw,2015-01-06T06:11:51.892Z,@benstoltz Haha. Haven't heard much about those guys.
odrisck,2015-01-06T06:11:58.366Z,right on
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:12:11.955Z,@JordanW I was much more into that scene when I was younger. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:12:26.709Z,"Yea. I have a new business client too. He has very little traffic right now, but I wanna help him with that. www.billcomptonartwork.com"
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:13:04.507Z,"My client's are very picky with their stuff, I swear there's so much more I could do, but that's part of the job, hitting the needs of your client. :)"
odrisck,2015-01-06T06:13:09.732Z,I can't believe Vampire bill is having traffic problems :)
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:13:14.270Z,@JordanW Fan of Type O neg?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:13:14.754Z,He hee.

mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:15:38.129Z,one vote for #1. Anyone else?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:15:50.016Z,"Yes. Though he's never actually watched True Blood. (I on the other hand have seen it all, wasn't happy with where they went at the end. lol)"
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:15:50.974Z,(loves the crowdsourcing)
StevenKW,2015-01-06T06:16:03.551Z,What do you charge an eyebrow threader for a website?
StevenKW,2015-01-06T06:16:31.139Z,I always wonder about that for individuals
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:16:39.086Z,"LOL. Hadn't decided yet, depended on what she wanted to do. "
jordanw,2015-01-06T06:17:34.589Z,@benstoltz I like their sound.
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:17:44.426Z,"I do a sort of sliding scale in my head based on size of the project, meaning, how many pages, how much work do I have to do to the content, do I have to do graphic design or do they have their own logos, that kind of stuff all affects cost"

StevenKW,2015-01-06T06:19:39.858Z,So it would be for her business? I told a co-worker I was learning web development and she said oh my mom wants a website... I could imagine her want a ton of work for $40 or something.
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:19:46.284Z,"Honestly I use plain simple resumes, so I'm no help there."

mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:20:16.429Z,two votes for #1. Thanks for to the folks who prefer plain resumes for their input. :-)
BenClist,2015-01-06T06:20:30.191Z,@mjcCodes They're very pretty but the thing that's going to get you a job as a web developer is your code. So a strong portfolio and github profile is what will count
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:20:38.865Z,:) You're welcome @mjcCodes 
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:20:47.364Z,I agree with @BenClist 
cameronchong,2015-01-06T06:20:58.848Z,@BenClist I concur
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:21:05.454Z,@StevenKW I have been a freelancer for 10 years. stay away from the folks who want you to do things for cheap. 
StevenKW,2015-01-06T06:21:10.539Z,I thought those were Colorado cookies.
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:21:23.814Z,"@BenClist Yeah, I get that. But HOW are they going to look at my work if I don't stand out first?"
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:22:07.647Z,@StevenKW I've only got a few paying clients and they're always giving me more than I ask honestly. I just figure a designer/coder should be making at least 25-30 per hour of work
cameronchong,2015-01-06T06:22:12.443Z,@mjcCodes With relevant experience 
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:22:24.642Z,@cameronchong ROFL
cameronchong,2015-01-06T06:22:46.359Z,Yeah that wasn't a joke
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:22:55.250Z,@cameronchong I know. 
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:23:25.979Z,"@cameronchong I wouldn't be looking for a gig doing this if I didn't have the experience. So, you're the hiring manager. You get say, 50 resumes for one position."
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:23:40.741Z,Will you be LOOKING at the portfolio of all 50 applicants?
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:23:43.120Z,"@JordanW Yeah, love how they sound. Let’s see…..what other bands can I introduce to you hahaha"
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:23:53.152Z,"@StevenKW Funny, I actually had got them advertising in High Times when I worked there, but we went a different direction as the school market devloped... "
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:24:26.272Z,When they had a smaller retail box we used to sell them on ThinkGeek
cameronchong,2015-01-06T06:24:33.523Z,"@mjcCodes No, I would take those who are most qualified on paper then look at samples of work"
jordanw,2015-01-06T06:24:36.480Z,@benstoltz Listening to Lionize and Red Fang lately.
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:24:42.981Z,It's a family business. 
StevenKW,2015-01-06T06:24:54.976Z,@mjcCodes either one is good.
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:25:04.333Z,"@JordanW oh goodie, more new music to listen to! Thanks!"
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T06:25:15.574Z,@StevenKW Thanks!
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:25:34.134Z,"@JordanW Hadn’t heard of them, but already like Lionize."
jordanw,2015-01-06T06:26:33.013Z,And a healthy dose of score music while programming.
benstoltz,2015-01-06T06:26:48.098Z,Ever listen to Afrocelt sound system?
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T06:27:00.738Z,I love listening to trance a lot of the time when I really want to get lost in my code.

mjcCodes,2015-01-06T07:48:13.852Z,@serhiicss What specifically are you working on today?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T07:48:17.413Z,Okay i'm going i'm out to buy stuff
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T07:48:23.038Z,will be back in a while
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T07:48:31.638Z,@AmmarAliShah happy shopping!
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T07:48:49.309Z,@mjcCodes thanks
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T07:49:00.800Z,It's more vegetables buying then shopping!
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T07:49:16.408Z,lol
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T07:57:53.024Z,I really think the robot lesson is a creative way of teaching css positioning... which can be pretty tricky. 
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T07:58:09.678Z,"@ESOComputing Yeah, I think so too. "
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T07:58:21.044Z,I loved that lesson!
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T08:00:44.419Z,"alright everyone, time for lunch and then to finish my resume. "
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T08:00:58.591Z,Ciao
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T08:01:02.668Z,cheers everyone!
mjcCodes,2015-01-06T08:01:22.842Z,@ESOComputing super nice talking to you. :-)
ESOComputing,2015-01-06T08:02:41.722Z,Likewise. @mjcCodes  I'm sure we'll meet again. :)

frankmaina,2015-01-06T08:41:10.727Z,@RussEby thats late!
RussEby,2015-01-06T08:41:50.688Z,I work nights. 6pm - 6am
frankmaina,2015-01-06T08:43:44.285Z,@RussEby self-employed?
RussEby,2015-01-06T08:45:17.949Z,"@frankmaina No, I work in a support center. Nice thing is that at night there isn't much to do, but we need to be 24 hours, so I sit. And study, until the phone rings."
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T08:48:19.955Z,@RussEby now that's a good job
RussEby,2015-01-06T08:50:32.990Z,"It can be, I spend six weeks with my days flipped. Family doesn't like having me sleep through the day."
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T08:53:24.501Z,@RussEby are you married?
RussEby,2015-01-06T08:54:08.355Z,"Yes, and 3 boys still at home. (1 daughter already on her own)"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T08:57:03.845Z,Wow!
frankmaina,2015-01-06T08:58:26.847Z,Thats  huge achievement.... @RussEby 
RussEby,2015-01-06T09:02:58.309Z,@frankmaina Thanks
RussEby,2015-01-06T09:04:41.854Z,Are you two working as developers or in training?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:06:38.767Z,@RussEby i'ma 17 year old student
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:07:08.815Z,A student developer i guess
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:07:52.891Z,Im 20 years old. 
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:07:59.097Z,Still in University

frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:08:32.809Z,Student developer for me too..
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:08:57.240Z,@frankmaina what are you studying?
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:10:57.537Z,Computer science... You? @AmmarAliShah 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:13:10.246Z,Cambridge Ordinary Level
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:17:38.312Z,Thats high school? Right?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:18:02.866Z,yup
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:18:15.255Z,i graduate in 2017!
iyeager2004,2015-01-06T09:18:54.115Z,Hey all.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:19:13.288Z,@iyeager2004 Hey!
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:19:14.335Z,so which languages do you code in?
RussEby,2015-01-06T09:19:14.823Z,@iyeager2004 Hello
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:19:23.784Z,@iyeager2004 hi
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:20:30.403Z,"@frankmaina Python(it's been a while), HTML, CSS, JS(Basic and in learning) and jQuery(in learning)"
iyeager2004,2015-01-06T09:20:58.288Z,"If anyone has a second, I decided to play around with a new Ghost blog and have it running on my Koding page at the moment. Anyone want to take a look and give me feedback? http://uikk97d7b98b.iyeager.koding.io/"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:21:16.896Z,and I've dabbed into introductory tutorials randomly on YouTube of many more languages
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:21:35.488Z,@iyeager2004 wait i'll check it out
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:22:11.116Z,@iyeager2004 the theme doesn't seem to cope well with images
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:22:24.775Z,@AmmarAliShah 's opinoin may be biased. He's not a fan of IPSUM BACON
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:22:25.924Z,I have a similar one on my wordpress.com blog
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:22:49.798Z,@teddy-error I've never had bacon and never will!
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:23:06.068Z,Current blog: http://thewormofficial.wordpress.com/
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:23:42.143Z,Messing around with the self-hosted WordPress.org: http://thewormofficial.tk/wordpress/
iyeager2004,2015-01-06T09:23:43.782Z,Which images look wrong? The background?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:23:58.865Z,The header at the side
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:24:09.303Z,they don't really blend in
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:24:17.866Z,I have the same problem on my blog
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:24:25.648Z,maybe he means it's kinda low-res
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:25:53.925Z,but the site looks great in a smaller screen size. I re-sized my browser to check
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:26:28.247Z,I'll be here another hour. Then i leave for my Math class
iyeager2004,2015-01-06T09:26:47.861Z,It is low-res. You think it looks better now? I dropped the opacity to almost transparent.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:27:49.435Z,"i think it's not the resolution, it's the position. On a smaller screen, the header moves up and looks great but it isn't looking good on the side"
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:28:23.063Z,"I heard someone today refer to our brain as ""Wetware"" lol"
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:29:26.644Z,wet software?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:29:41.239Z,lol
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:29:51.011Z,Not software
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:29:53.163Z,nor hardware
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:29:54.413Z,wetware
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:30:33.140Z,I planned on going through the W3School's HTML/CSS tutorial before going to math class but just stayed here...this chat is addictive

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:32:23.322Z,W3School is a good review
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:32:32.548Z,i try to do it every month or so
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:32:43.640Z,"HTMl, CSS and this time JS too"
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:33:56.543Z,@AmmarAliShah http://www.codeavengers.com/ maybe you'll like this one
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:34:10.329Z,already have the site bookmarked
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:34:27.052Z,I have a hole tutorials folder in my bookmark bar
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:34:37.089Z,wrong whole
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:34:44.002Z,thats what she said?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:35:04.054Z,she?
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:39:37.902Z,Are there any multiplayer coding games on there @AmmarAliShah  ?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:40:08.220Z,There is a website in which you play games. Coding games
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:40:19.127Z,but i believe they are for one person
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:40:28.268Z,let me check the list
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:41:21.679Z,http://codecombat.com is multiplayer
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:41:32.859Z,Another one for my list
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:41:49.665Z,I'm actually going to go through a few when i get time
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:41:53.369Z,http://www.checkio.org/
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:42:01.328Z,This is a challenges one ^
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:43:50.145Z,@teddy-error  interesting...
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:45:41.295Z,@teddy-error interesting site
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:45:51.470Z,People new to coding will love it
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:46:48.988Z,it even teaches Lua!
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:46:56.596Z,I tried that lang out too
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:47:02.056Z,and Scala too!
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:48:16.810Z,It seems kinda buggy tho heads up
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:48:24.305Z,like I am constantly failing the tutorials
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:48:51.781Z,because of weird things like unit collision (outside of my control) preventing objective completion
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:49:14.735Z,@teddy-error what's your current programming state? How many languages do you know?
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:52:51.564Z,I have a thing against javascript.. I just dont know why i have never gotten myself to learn it... except node.js changed that abit..
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:54:29.521Z,"I'm new to web dev as I was kinda turned off by HTML and CSS (working with them is like trying to get two toddlers to play nice, and when they don't you have no idea why) But I come from a weird background of writing code to automate video games. I learned programming in this language called Pascal. I learned some HTML to make websites for my friends in school. Then I went to college for awhile for Computer Science, where I picked up Python, C++, and Java."
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:54:53.709Z,I never learned proper punctuation though.
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:54:54.880Z,:D
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:55:53.317Z,You actually learned Pascal! Now that's an old language
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:56:06.230Z,Did you also learn Algol?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:56:13.291Z,:laughing: 
frankmaina,2015-01-06T09:56:41.255Z,and delphi??
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:56:46.901Z,and delphi
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:57:18.317Z,I tried Java! Python was my lang for over an year!
teddy-error,2015-01-06T09:57:24.665Z,I was writing some like mouse hooking stuff and basic monitor (color) scraping code. It was for this game called Runescape.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T09:58:17.878Z,C++: my cousin gave me a book(He's studying Electrical engineering and hates code) as a gift but haven't tried to learn c++ yet
RussEby,2015-01-06T09:58:19.277Z,@teddy-error Borland!!!! Turbo Pascal Rocks!
RussEby,2015-01-06T09:59:32.219Z,Turbo Pascal was my first language. Loved it.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T10:00:03.054Z,Okay i'll be going now. It's 3 PM and i leave at 3:30 PM. Have to get ready 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T10:00:04.372Z,Bye!
frankmaina,2015-01-06T10:00:39.180Z,people say python will end up forgotten like pascal and all those other forgotten ones
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:00:50.956Z,I can't say I've ever benefitted from having the low-level perspective of how code works but I'm glad I got to play with C++. We didn't get a chance to use any modern C++ things like smart pointers. Just old school simple C++.
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:02:09.916Z,Yeah @RussEby Wasn't Pascal like the standard computer science intro language back in the 80's ?
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:02:14.973Z,90's
RussEby,2015-01-06T10:04:18.612Z,"@teddy-error in the 80's My high school taught Apple BASIC, when I went to college it was Visual Basic. I used Turbo Pascal at home."
RussEby,2015-01-06T10:05:46.675Z,I picked up Turbo Pascal because Borland was selling it for $50 and the C compilers were $500 and up. the only free one was BASIC. Of course that was the 80's.
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:11:23.334Z,that is horrifying D:
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:11:35.210Z,that compilers were not free
RussEby,2015-01-06T10:15:02.757Z,"By the 90's they became more common, even today there are Development tools that aren't free. Some of the game engines have large fees."
Nocando,2015-01-06T10:18:06.562Z,Hello guys!
Nocando,2015-01-06T10:18:52.211Z,I am very confused on what major I should go for..
frankmaina,2015-01-06T10:19:43.007Z,@Nocando what are your options?
Nocando,2015-01-06T10:20:09.688Z,Whether I should go for a design or cs major
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:20:42.958Z,"Of course, but compilers are hardly ""commercial software"". I guess it was a different mentality back then. Today it's like the more people using your language the better."
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:21:17.694Z,Nobody cares if you have a design degree
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:21:37.644Z,"People care a lot if you have a CS degree, but probably not for a design job"
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:22:23.859Z,"I mean to say that if you're working as an artist, what reflects your capabilities the most is your portfolio"
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:29:17.365Z,Seems like CodeSchool videos are down right now
teddy-error,2015-01-06T10:29:20.554Z,:(
RussEby,2015-01-06T10:29:53.232Z,"@teddy-error I think it has more to do with the device then the language. MS, Apple and Google all give away SDKs and IDEs for their devices. But a third party (like the Game Engines) will charge for their Kits/IDEs. I credit open source projects making the tools available as cheap/free as they are."
ezekeal,2015-01-06T11:14:09.469Z,hello world! nice to meet you

BitTinker,2015-01-06T12:15:53.491Z,"Haha I'm East Coast US. So no, not too early. At least, not for High School Zack, who was fine with such things. Old Man Zack is a tad grumpy :P (Also not really old, but he's also a chronic over-exaggerator)."
cshutchinson,2015-01-06T12:16:49.874Z,yeah I am East Coast US too so trying to get couple hours in before getting the little one to pre-school and me off to work
cshutchinson,2015-01-06T12:17:16.602Z,was itching to finish the Stanford stuff and be done with it
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T12:18:28.676Z,Morning state-siders
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T12:18:38.459Z,Hello to the rest of you :)
cshutchinson,2015-01-06T12:18:42.103Z,@sircharleswatson Good morning!!!
BitTinker,2015-01-06T12:23:01.044Z,"@cshutchinson Same story here, minus the preschooler :) This is super new for me so trying to establish a routine, typically though I try to get in an hour most mornings before headed off to the day job, works well because the wife is doing online school also."
terakilobyte,2015-01-06T12:23:10.413Z,@sircharleswatson likely story. Good morning all
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T12:23:30.080Z,likely story?
sagarhani,2015-01-06T12:30:03.996Z,"Hi,"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T12:30:23.584Z,hello @sagarhani 
sagarhani,2015-01-06T12:30:37.196Z,Hi @sircharleswatson 
sagarhani,2015-01-06T12:30:57.718Z,any small projects to start with?
apexpred,2015-01-06T12:46:25.025Z,Good Morning FCC
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T12:53:33.002Z,good morning @apexpred 
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:17:04.786Z,Good morning folks
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:18:20.348Z,Morning everyone
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:18:47.563Z,Morning @CinnamonB 
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:19:02.947Z,Morning @benstoltz 
apexpred,2015-01-06T13:19:15.045Z,Morning!
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:20:52.533Z,ahoy @apexpred 
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:20:58.209Z,How are folks doing this morning?
sophiasgaler,2015-01-06T13:21:12.404Z,hello world I'm new!
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:21:35.376Z,Welcome @sophiasgaler! :)
apexpred,2015-01-06T13:21:44.564Z,Welcome To FCC!
serhiicss,2015-01-06T13:25:46.661Z,@CinnamonB @benstoltz @apexpred @apexpred @sophiasgaler Hello and welcome/welcome back! :)
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:26:26.475Z,Hey @serhiicss thanks for the welcome. I'm usually here but not engaged in the convo as much. How are you?
serhiicss,2015-01-06T13:26:38.097Z,I am very well. Thank you!
serhiicss,2015-01-06T13:26:45.464Z,Today is a great day for coding/learning!
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:27:14.895Z,Yes it is.
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:27:53.472Z,"Had a question to ask you @serhiicss what's it like using Sublime Text 3, I'm currently using 2 and not sure if I want to upgrade it."
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:28:21.876Z,3 is so much nicer
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:28:23.396Z,but
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:28:29.735Z,Development has all but stopped.
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:28:39.639Z,Oh really?
JimBry,2015-01-06T13:28:45.396Z,Good Morning everybody!
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:28:45.503Z,"Wow, how come."
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:28:58.540Z,Morning @JimBry 
serhiicss,2015-01-06T13:28:59.251Z,Honestly I am not advanced far enough to see the difference. But I always try to use most recent versions of any tools.
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:29:02.576Z,"Take a look at Atom as a potential alternative, it’s very similar appearance wise/functionality wise and has massssive development behind it"
BitTinker,2015-01-06T13:30:01.863Z,"Curious: has anyone tried Brackets? Found a link to it from Twitter and it seems super easy to use for me, not sure how it stacks up against Sublime/Atom which I haven't tried but have heard good things about."
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:30:41.758Z,"Negative, I tend to use Webstorm/pycharm for my heavy dev work and then switch over to sublime or atom for one off work"
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:30:53.915Z,@benstoltz I'm considering Atom but really got comfy with ST2 for the last yr
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:31:39.009Z,I might consider alternating between the too
martyla,2015-01-06T13:31:46.824Z,Hello
martyla,2015-01-06T13:31:59.744Z,I am new here
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:32:04.849Z,"@CinnamonB I know what you mean, but it’s a fairly similar experience. ST3 is still exceptionally good if you don’t mind very slow dev cycles/nonexistent ones. Apparently it’s still alive? but with only one dev"
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:32:14.866Z,Welcome @martyla!
serhiicss,2015-01-06T13:32:22.773Z,http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-smackdown-atom-vs-brackets-vs-light-table-vs-sublime-text/
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:32:31.087Z,"Hey @martyla Welcome, how did you hear about FCC?"
martyla,2015-01-06T13:32:53.076Z,/r/linux :D
serhiicss,2015-01-06T13:32:58.041Z,@martyla Welcome!
martyla,2015-01-06T13:33:11.993Z,"I've done a decent amount of programming (almost all backend software), but I came here with plans to dig into some front-end JS"
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:34:19.775Z,Hello everyone....Man we keep growing like crazy huh? 
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:34:27.138Z,That sounds amazing @martyla ... You're going to have an exciting experience through this journey of learning and coding. 
serhiicss,2015-01-06T13:34:29.274Z,As far as best text editor/IDE out there. Stick to what works best for you :)
BitTinker,2015-01-06T13:34:33.556Z,Thanks for the advice everybody! @serhiicss @benstoltz @CinnamonB 
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:34:51.601Z,@BitTinker no problem :smile: 
serhiicss,2015-01-06T13:35:27.933Z,There is a good number of developers out there still using Notepad++ 
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:35:39.661Z,"I've seen Atom but at the time didn't have the proper Mac OS to try it on, but now I would definitely try it out."
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:35:55.789Z,I am a Sublimer myself
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:36:09.541Z,@metalhaze Hey
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:36:16.445Z,Sup @CinnamonB 
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:36:55.896Z,"I like the plugins, especially those that you have to dig and find to continue using. That's what I had to do with the sidebar enhancements"
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:36:58.011Z,"At the time, Sublime was the only totally cross platform editor of its kind that was cheap.....(that I was aware of)"
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:37:27.391Z,Atom and Brackets didn't exist
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:40:22.963Z,"True, at the time is what I also thought. There's new ones coming out each day. I think it would be cool to try and make my own (bit far fetched of an idea, but it's possible)"
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:41:24.608Z, @CinnamonB Atom will be the editor you always wanted. Once something like goes open source it's almost not even worth making your own unless it absolutely sucked....In which case I would just fork it and re-write it haha
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:41:43.229Z,But Atom is the open-source Sublime
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:41:48.092Z,it will be amazing in the future
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:42:00.631Z,It’s pretty darn awesome atm :P
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:42:05.440Z,"Oooo, Open Source, had no idea"
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:42:12.073Z,Speeded up quite a lot since I originally dl’ed it
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:42:50.175Z,"Well, your standards are higher coming from Sublime haha....Atom is playing catch up"
apexpred,2015-01-06T13:43:39.443Z,I love using brackets
admhlt,2015-01-06T13:43:42.223Z,Mornin' code campers
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:44:05.940Z,Morning @admhlt 
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:44:37.617Z,"Which theme do you use for Atom, there's so many good ones to choose from"
admhlt,2015-01-06T13:44:38.100Z,"I've really been enjoying Brackets too, even though I usually steer clear of anything Adobe touches"
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:44:44.755Z,"Brackets is great and all but I tried to inspect the CSS on an element and it took like a full 30 seconds to open the preview window. I promptly closed the app and went back to Sublime haha.....I will return to it when it isn't so ""alpha"""
apexpred,2015-01-06T13:45:08.737Z,really it works really fast for me @metalhaze 
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:46:01.829Z,coding little projects and using it with production code on a full web app is a bit different. It seems to choke hard on large files
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:46:43.253Z,I just end up using webstorm on mid/large sized projects tbh.
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:46:54.299Z,could have been something I installed too....but I don't know how to track which thing I have installed that could be the culprit
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:47:07.368Z,since you can install 3rd party plugins
metalhaze,2015-01-06T13:47:13.675Z,or packages rather
apexpred,2015-01-06T13:48:07.848Z,I would use an ide if they weren't so ugly compared to a text editor
benstoltz,2015-01-06T13:50:11.014Z,Well I’m going to take off and do some work away from/off chat. Less distractions. talk to you all later
CinnamonB,2015-01-06T13:50:27.429Z,Later @benstoltz 
Phonbopit,2015-01-06T13:56:17.611Z,anyone use Vim? I always fall when trying to use it :worried: 
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-06T14:04:54.576Z,Hey guys
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-06T14:05:13.608Z,@Phonbopit I think ST3 is more than enough for completing the lessons & experimenting
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-06T14:06:03.512Z,"Btw, how should I begin building my portfolio?"
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-06T14:06:24.978Z,I want to start looking for a web development job but I have to get some little projects up on my site

cshutchinson,2015-01-06T14:25:34.514Z,@figitalboy I look forward to working on these non-profits soon. I am working hard to complete the challenges. Be talking to you soon when I finish!
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T14:25:47.490Z,Great!
serhiicss,2015-01-06T14:30:26.059Z,Is there a way to see some of the non-profit projects completed by students of FCC?
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T14:31:38.343Z,"FCC is actually in its infancy, so there’s not much I could point to yet. I can show you all the nonprofits waiting for us to finish the challenges and get started though. one sec"

CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T14:32:14.396Z,There are 15 to choose from there and probably just as many in the pipeline
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T14:32:46.515Z,"@alexandruolteanu If you ever forget who does what, just ask the room and someone will point you in the right direction. If you finish the challenges I’ll know and will probably be reaching out to you, anyway"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T14:34:25.102Z,Feel free to bookmark the trello and keep looking back. There’s probably going to be a new project on there by the end of the day

alexandruolteanu,2015-01-06T14:57:39.118Z,I've heard very good things about his videos
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T14:57:45.828Z,It is so cold!!
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T14:58:00.989Z,Well 2 inches of snow just shut down parts of DC. What a wimpy city
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T14:58:16.821Z,HA! So wimpy
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T14:58:18.115Z,My wife’s work has no power. From two inches of snow? Did that seriously fell a tree?
Nocando,2015-01-06T14:58:31.482Z,Today's goal : Complete 8 challenge.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T14:58:37.566Z,they have brittle trees there apparently :P
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T14:59:31.655Z,it's -20 right now
Nocando,2015-01-06T14:59:45.620Z,I feel like im in a rut today. Idk if I want to change my major... I'm still a freshman.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:01:13.582Z,@Nocando what seems more interesting to you? design or CS?
Nocando,2015-01-06T15:03:19.159Z,I think they're both equivalent
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T15:04:20.076Z,Go for SE
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:04:52.877Z,idk if I can be much help because I skipped college :P Decided I'd rather save the money and teach myself
greg-js,2015-01-06T15:06:23.978Z,"Hi, I went back a bit in the chat and read about the working on projects part still (understandably) being in its infancy - so are people doing working in team on these projects already or is that something to come in the near future?"
greg-js,2015-01-06T15:07:01.338Z,"And damn I wish I skipped college, I wasted so much of my time there it's not even funny"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:07:07.965Z,@wdgreg The projects will be completed using pair programming
Nocando,2015-01-06T15:07:13.817Z,"I want to teach myself, I enjoy this method of learning. I've learned much faster and easier . I just feel pressured because my parents want me to bring back home a piece a paper."
greg-js,2015-01-06T15:07:49.386Z,"@figitalboy I see, that's great, what software is used for this? tmux?"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:07:54.623Z,"You would not be on your own, and I will be there to help set expectations for the nonprofit"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:08:54.143Z,"@Nocando Tell them that's not how your career field operates anymore. Most companies look for projects/real experience. Which you will gain from here (FCC). In this field, a recommendation from the non-profits will get you a job faster than someone who went to college and hasn't done any real work yet"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:09:22.011Z,@wdgreg We’ve used several different apps to pair in the past few months. Right now the flavor of the week is Screenhero
Nocando,2015-01-06T15:09:27.343Z,"So I figured, If I go to a designer's route in college and learn the technical side of development at the same time just for now until I'm ready to get hired as a Front-End Web Developer."
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:09:29.536Z,but the actual software you use doesn’t really matter to me
Nocando,2015-01-06T15:09:52.540Z,Note: I'm attending a community college.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T15:09:55.169Z,"After being here for almost a month(i think), wondered just now: do we use MEAN.io or MEAN.js"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:09:59.300Z,as long as your partner agrees to it you’re alright
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:10:14.844Z,@AmmarAliShah I would recommend MEAN.js
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:11:19.894Z,"but they were both created by the same person. MEAN.io first. but the company the guy was working for, wanted to capitalize on MEAN.io and he disagreed with that, so he left the company and started MEAN.js"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T15:11:40.633Z,yeah read many blogs on this
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:12:00.042Z,"@Nocando well, at least you aren't spending 25k+ per year. that helps I guess :P"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:12:23.507Z,"I say go to college, just to be contrarian "
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:12:34.770Z,"@AmmarAliShah ya. so, I would definitely say MEAN.js - even though .io is more popular"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:12:47.442Z,But that’s a heavy decision and the weight of a couple guys on an online chat probably shouldn’t factor into it too much
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T15:13:03.611Z,this ^
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:14:25.385Z,"@Nocando It’s smart to do 2 years at a community college and transfer to a 4 year if you want a bachelors. You’ll save a lot of money and it sounds like you already know that. In the meantime, my favorite quote apropos this is"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:14:33.470Z,don’t let your education get in the way of your learning
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:14:55.185Z,so keep working through challenges on FCC and stay hungry for knowledge
apexpred,2015-01-06T15:15:28.770Z,If you can afford college you should go. That is my opinion
Nocando,2015-01-06T15:15:29.558Z,"haha, that's my favorite quote"
Nocando,2015-01-06T15:15:49.707Z,Mark Twain
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:16:01.092Z,nailed it
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:16:03.036Z,"""afford college"" is subjective"

sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:16:31.365Z,"can you ""afford"" college if you're taking tens of thousands of dollars in debt to get through it?"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:16:43.250Z,"Yeah totally. And you’re right @sircharleswatson that a degree isn’t necessary to work in webdev. But say he tires of it, or decides it’s not what he wants to do in life. A degree is a nice backup to have"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:17:00.009Z,you sure could
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:17:09.459Z,just have to do a ROI calculation for your major
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:18:00.149Z,I personally just don't see the benefit. but that's just me. I like being 25 and having no debt :) haha
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T15:18:02.686Z,"@sircharleswatson some time ago i tweeted: "".io vs .js"". all the replies favored .js "
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:19:05.570Z,@AmmarAliShah yup. I would stick with the guy who originated the project. which means .js is where it's at.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:19:15.129Z,it also has better documentation
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T15:19:33.998Z,i've got both of em open right now
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T15:19:42.060Z,i'll check out the documentation
ksharifbd,2015-01-06T15:20:11.642Z,Hello
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:20:12.530Z,the .js docs are more clear and easy to follow imo
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:20:26.142Z,Hello @ksharifbd 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T15:20:48.759Z,@ksharifbd hey!

ksharifbd,2015-01-06T15:25:19.293Z,Yeah. kind of busy with other stuffs. From now on hopefully I will be regular here @AmmarAliShah

Nocando,2015-01-06T15:25:35.854Z,I should try other browsers
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:25:42.519Z,There’s also an app you can download

Nocando,2015-01-06T15:27:25.259Z,Okay I'm on firefox now
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T15:27:46.604Z,@Nocando there's also a Chrome extension 
Nocando,2015-01-06T15:28:35.947Z,What chrome extension?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T15:28:44.847Z,the desktop app is pretty much just as bad. I had to manually refresh a lot when I had that
greg-js,2015-01-06T15:28:55.238Z,You might also try an android IRC app and connect to irc.gitter.im using your github name and the password you get from the site. works fine on irssi and weechat
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T15:29:10.979Z,"@sircharleswatson it’s pretty bad when someone tags my name. I have to reload to get it to go away, even if I saw the message."
Nocando,2015-01-06T15:29:58.111Z,"No android xD. It's fine. I think it's just my laptop. When I'm on my desktop, I wouldn't have to manually refresh my browser."

seahik,2015-01-06T16:21:35.190Z,"so no jquery on gh pages, correct?"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T16:22:52.869Z,@seahik you could probably use jquery on gh-pages
serhiicss,2015-01-06T16:25:47.551Z,you can use jquery on gh pages
seahik,2015-01-06T16:26:02.650Z,ah cool!  that makes it sort of dynamic doesn't?
seahik,2015-01-06T16:26:09.370Z,not completely static
serhiicss,2015-01-06T16:26:53.386Z,"js is loaded by browser, no back end needed"

seahik,2015-01-06T16:32:30.411Z,@serhiicss I like your site - looks great.

brandenbyers,2015-01-06T16:34:09.065Z,"@seahik with gh-pages, you can do pretty much anything client-side javascript. You can even pull in dynamic data using things like firebase or hooking into any other API."

seahik,2015-01-06T16:38:51.950Z,@ksharifbd ask away!  lots of great help here.  Can also ask in the Help chat room

benstoltz,2015-01-06T17:16:49.408Z,"No reason not too. @Nocando. As time goes on and you learn more you could phase it out and write the styling yourself, but to start there isn’t any problem with using it."

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T17:17:22.605Z,@Nocando nope
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T17:17:26.476Z,don't stop now
Nocando,2015-01-06T17:17:57.821Z,@AmmarAliShah why is that?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T17:18:24.394Z,@Nocando get your self use to making responsive stuff
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T17:18:47.083Z,It's good to pick up new stuff and trends as you learn
mlysin,2015-01-06T17:19:13.801Z,anyone using react?
Nocando,2015-01-06T17:19:41.956Z,"Thats true, I'm just using it for right now so I can place my works Then, I can update it with my own styles and let go of bootstrap."

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T17:22:36.306Z,@Nocando i'll tell you one thing: it's time consuming
benstoltz,2015-01-06T17:22:39.002Z,@Nocando Yeah that’s fine. It’s perfectly fine in my opinion to do the site up with Bootstrap now…..but remember to come back to it try to redo as much as possible with your own code so you learn how.
Nocando,2015-01-06T17:23:36.194Z,I haven't taken into an account that coding is time consuming. I need to chill and realize that I can't do everything quick

CodeNonprofit,2015-01-06T17:28:35.208Z,you could start a hackathon
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T17:28:47.747Z,I could but who would come to it?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T17:29:00.743Z,Only one of my friend codes
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T17:29:05.155Z,Only one

mikeelliott,2015-01-06T17:45:20.109Z,@seahik I have checked their classes out and ended up subscribing to codeschool and treehouse to get more up to speed on javascript but have found codeschool to be the most useful. I thought udemy was charging more than that so will have to go check out the special.
Rybar,2015-01-06T17:45:35.868Z,"wow, if that udemy course went into back-end at all, I'd snap it up in a heartbeat. I feel like most front-end stuff is thoroughly covered through multiple other resources though"
seahik,2015-01-06T17:46:17.845Z,does PHP and mySQL count as back end a little?
Rybar,2015-01-06T17:46:46.214Z,absolutely
Rybar,2015-01-06T17:47:06.882Z,"even if you go MEAN stack, chances are high you'"
Rybar,2015-01-06T17:47:35.264Z,you'll run into SQL in a lot of jobsd
seahik,2015-01-06T17:47:40.367Z,that Udemy course has 20 classes each on mySQL and PHP
seahik,2015-01-06T17:47:56.928Z,There is 235 lessons in total!
Rybar,2015-01-06T17:48:24.248Z,derp I missed the 'load all' at the bottom. thought it only covered front-end and intermediate javascript looking at the first page of lessons

Rybar,2015-01-06T17:50:31.308Z,code school's JS course is great IMO.
seahik,2015-01-06T17:51:03.779Z,"But I think after dipping my toes into different low cost and free tuturials, I will be more willing to pay a bit for some really good books, or classes."
Rybar,2015-01-06T17:51:06.575Z,"@seahik This looks fantastic, is a steal for $10.  Really positive reviews too I see"
serhiicss,2015-01-06T17:51:26.225Z,"@Maximization Thank you! Apparently, the easiest way is to replace < with &lt; and > with &gt;"
seahik,2015-01-06T17:51:34.203Z,@Rybar yeah it doesnt seem like you can go wrong by 10 bucks!
serhiicss,2015-01-06T17:51:36.734Z,"ugh, can't see it here"
mikeelliott,2015-01-06T17:51:44.045Z,"@Rybar @seahik if you also search for node.js on udemy, they've got a ton of courses but my question is this: For someone relatively new to javascript is it better to just stick with the FCC curriculum or does it make sense to venture off and dig  a little deeper into javascript just to make sure I'm up to speed when it comes time to pair program so I can pull my weight?"
Rybar,2015-01-06T17:52:21.212Z,"you can never go wrong studying extra things, just try to stay focused on one subject at a time"
seahik,2015-01-06T17:52:34.230Z,@mikeelliott I've had exact same concerns.  As i feel there is a skill gap after you finish codeacademy and being able to do the coderbyte challenges
seahik,2015-01-06T17:53:21.612Z,I'm slowing making my way through  [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
Rybar,2015-01-06T17:53:28.283Z,agreed @mikeelliott Codecademy needs supplemented with ^
mikeelliott,2015-01-06T17:53:31.898Z,"@Rybar Got it, that's why I'm just sticking with the topics in the FCC curriculum and not branching into other languages"
seahik,2015-01-06T17:55:27.727Z,Do entry level front end web developes use a lot of tricky JS?
benstoltz,2015-01-06T17:56:07.302Z,What do you mean by tricky js?
seahik,2015-01-06T17:56:21.495Z,"(but really I'm more intersted in back end, so I feel like it's well worth studying JS in depth?)"
seahik,2015-01-06T17:56:59.891Z,"lol...well everything above Codecade,y is tricky to me at this point."
seahik,2015-01-06T17:57:45.240Z,"ah maybe not everything, just reading the first 4 chapters on Eloquent JS has helped a lot.  But i'm having to reread stuff...so feels tricky to me."
seahik,2015-01-06T17:58:20.915Z,tricky == schtuff I haven't learned (I suppose!)
benstoltz,2015-01-06T17:58:47.466Z,si tricky === stuff you haven’t learned or practiced yet
seahik,2015-01-06T17:59:07.437Z,yarp
seahik,2015-01-06T17:59:32.911Z,I'm sure the more I re-read it will make sense.  It just takes time.
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:00:12.363Z,"Always remember, when you’re reading books or watching a video, take the time to write the code being shown. Explore it, break it, fix it. Learn what it does/what makes it tick."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:00:17.014Z,@seahik Don't feel about about rereading EloquentJS. It's a good book and explains things well. So it will only be to your benefit
Maximization,2015-01-06T18:01:24.512Z,ch5 and all the high-order functions got me confused big time
seahik,2015-01-06T18:02:07.989Z,I needed to change my mindset after doing Codecademy courses which you can kind of plow through.   Reading EJS needs a more slower approach.
Maximization,2015-01-06T18:02:11.308Z,"I understand abstraction, but JS does this in a very unclear manner"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:02:57.608Z,I'm starting with these tonight(in PDF): http://www.abookapart.com/products/
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:03:31.585Z,"Almost every senior developer recommends ""every title"" in the serieds"

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:03:45.881Z,So that's exactly what i'm doing
seahik,2015-01-06T18:04:41.285Z,ah interesting I haven't seen these. thanks!
Maximization,2015-01-06T18:04:42.904Z,"```
function unless(test, then) {
  if (!test) then();
}
function repeat(times, body) {
  for (var i = 0; i < times; i++) body(i);
}

repeat(3, function(n) {
  unless(n % 2, function() {
    console.log(n, ""is even"");
  });
});
// → 0 is even
// → 2 is even
```
this is where it starts to get confusing"
Maximization,2015-01-06T18:05:09.505Z,if you try to trace the program line by line and stack by stack it's a complex thing
seahik,2015-01-06T18:05:45.349Z,is that a technique people use...to sort of draw out the sequence?  (actually I'm sure it is....silly question)
Maximization,2015-01-06T18:07:00.069Z,from what i understand it's an abstraction technique to wrap code into an abstract function which in turn serves for another (higher order) function
Maximization,2015-01-06T18:07:06.168Z,and this can go several levels deep
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:08:37.422Z,"I only have the first 7 books from the ""A Book Apart"" library"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:08:45.107Z,:-(
seahik,2015-01-06T18:11:55.585Z,"in wonder if there is special techniques other than just obviously studying it, that help understand these abstractions"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:13:05.516Z,@seahik here's something i do: I ask Simon Allardice(you must have heard of him)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:13:24.927Z,read the documentation
seahik,2015-01-06T18:14:40.895Z,@AmmarAliShah i have now..he's a teacher on Lynda.com?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:14:59.405Z,yup
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:15:15.568Z,He's very popular 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:15:47.916Z,Just take 1 course from him...His accent will get stuck in your mind
seahik,2015-01-06T18:16:09.343Z,"@sircharleswatson like MOZdev, or?  it's so dry though.  At least EJS is written with some entertainment value."
seahik,2015-01-06T18:18:24.806Z,but I definitely do look on it more and more....Anyhoo it's all good! The learning is fun and interesting...just takes time!
seahik,2015-01-06T18:18:47.494Z,@AmmarAliShah ok thanks for tip..i've heard good things about lynda.com
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:18:59.990Z,Documentation is inherently boring. But as you progress in development you’ll need to learn how to read it….despite it being boring :P
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:19:09.540Z,or super dry
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:19:22.442Z,@seahik it's a great website but sadly i can't pay for the membership
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:19:24.200Z,I don't find it boring
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:19:31.698Z,but I don't sit there and read the whole thing
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:19:40.103Z,I just look for what I need at the moment
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:19:42.372Z,(neither do I @sircharleswatson)
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:19:46.821Z,And ditto
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:20:10.243Z,Okay….I do admit sometimes I’ll just read through documentation….>.>
seahik,2015-01-06T18:20:33.776Z,ok back to reading EJS :D for me
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:20:44.439Z,@seahik PDF?
seahik,2015-01-06T18:21:06.215Z,[EJS](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)  it's free online
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:25:08.639Z,i just downloaded it in PDF
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:25:15.210Z,i like to read on my htc
bboyjacks,2015-01-06T18:25:57.338Z,EJS is awesome!
bboyjacks,2015-01-06T18:26:12.202Z,Great thing is you can play with the codes online
seahik,2015-01-06T18:26:24.493Z,ah cool....it also has exercises with a really nice sandbox to play with code
seahik,2015-01-06T18:26:43.065Z,ha...what @bboyjacks said
bboyjacks,2015-01-06T18:27:26.433Z,Messing with the codes are very very effective learning tool. It's a brilliant idea actually. Wish all programming books are like EJS
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:28:00.425Z,I still maintain it’s best to write the code out by scratch and then play with it.
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:28:09.293Z,from scratch*
bboyjacks,2015-01-06T18:30:29.704Z,Whatever floats your boat
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:31:02.190Z,it definitely is best to write out all code
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:31:14.497Z,even if it's included (like in EloquentJS)
iheartkode,2015-01-06T18:31:20.135Z,Writing code helps you learn it..

benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:48:00.238Z,"Or just the structure of the project, presuming that’s the problem"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-06T18:48:18.309Z,UML! UML! UML! UML!
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:48:25.351Z,lawl
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:51:25.469Z,"part of the problem is that there is a wide variety of methods that are filtered through an API that has some vague methods. And... everything is in one stinkin file! (well, not everything, but a majority)"
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:51:38.577Z,O.o
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:51:54.682Z,Is it iOS or js? (if you can say)
iheartkode,2015-01-06T18:52:08.540Z,Meteor
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:52:24.388Z,JS
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:52:32.216Z,"ya, it's a meteor project"
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:52:45.727Z,Wait…it’s a meteor file with the js all in one file?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:52:52.316Z,"well, meteor/node api/Postgres"
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:53:07.070Z,That just sounds…….like it’ll drive you insane
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:53:36.991Z,"@benstoltz ya, not _everything_ is in one file. but there are like 30+ methods per file and it's ridiculous"

sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:53:52.242Z,and the methods are LOOOOONG
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:53:57.295Z,you could refactor things?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:53:57.456Z,doing like 20 things per method
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:54:32.674Z,"@benstoltz I _could_ but the client said that because we're a small team, we need to focus on what brings in the money. and worry about refactoring/organizing later"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:54:38.062Z,**UGH**
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:54:42.687Z,oh god…..

sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T18:55:06.208Z,the whole project in general is awesome. but working with the code is not
benstoltz,2015-01-06T18:56:11.816Z,"You could mention that regardless of being a small team, refactoring/organizing will make you more efficient in the long run and your code will be of higher quality and ultimately you will code faster"

sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T19:24:29.945Z,@phlacin the reason it's disappointing is because my friend said they need help with the cms/backend stuff. but then I found out it's in python :/ _wah wah_

seahik,2015-01-06T20:12:23.941Z,nice we can discuss the material!  I started watching the lessons...seems easy to follow and informative.  One thing I noticed that strikes me as strange.  Lots of teachers seem to be reverting to handwritting lessons.  I'm not sure why...but man his penmanship is messy!  (on the mongo class)
seahik,2015-01-06T20:13:04.780Z,it's just surprising to me that one would choose to handwrite when you can use powerpoint etc....but maybe teachers believe handwriting is more engaging?

Maximization,2015-01-06T21:41:21.143Z,"Question to all, would you consider putting a certificate of completing an online course on your linkedIn? Question to recruiters (are there here any at all?), would you consider it a plus if a candidate has said certificates?"
Maximization,2015-01-06T21:42:28.827Z,"Besides from the fact that having portfolio and actually showing your skills is more important than a certificate, just to get the obvious out of the way"

benstoltz,2015-01-06T21:43:46.302Z,What I’ve seen done: If the course gives a badge write a script to access the badge and post it up on your about me section on your portfolio site
jordanw,2015-01-06T21:43:49.006Z,I would maybe put the MongoDB certification. Not the classes individually.
benstoltz,2015-01-06T21:44:05.377Z,List the portfolio site on your linkedin.
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T21:44:14.102Z,"Ya, the MongoDB certification is pretty good. and actually graded"
odrisck,2015-01-06T21:44:37.086Z,I'll be using the MongDB one yes
odrisck,2015-01-06T21:44:54.835Z,it depends totally on the course and who conducts it

brandenbyers,2015-01-06T22:12:36.754Z,@benstoltz I’ve been looking into backbone because I’m not sure how much I like Angular yet. I’ve also run into Ampersand.js. Have you looked into that?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-06T22:12:57.375Z,@iheartkode did you see the giant clock/dash thing you can open in a new window with RescueTime?
iheartkode,2015-01-06T22:13:37.188Z,no
benstoltz,2015-01-06T22:13:39.705Z,"@brndnb I have not looked at Ampersand.js. I’ve written the most with Backbone, and done some Angular and some Ember. "
iheartkode,2015-01-06T22:13:48.447Z,on the web app?
brandenbyers,2015-01-06T22:14:03.264Z,Do you prefer Backbone because that’s what you’re most familiar with?
brandenbyers,2015-01-06T22:14:40.791Z,Or is there just something specific you don’t like about Angular?
iheartkode,2015-01-06T22:15:03.273Z,@sircharleswatson  Where?
benstoltz,2015-01-06T22:15:33.418Z,"It’s partially because I started out using Backbone. It’s partially because it’s very free form, you have to write everything in. "
benstoltz,2015-01-06T22:15:43.652Z,And then there’s a litanny of reasons I dislike angular.
brandenbyers,2015-01-06T22:15:56.937Z,"Oh, ok!"
benstoltz,2015-01-06T22:16:19.298Z,I don’t like so much JS in my HTML

apexpred,2015-01-07T00:22:11.295Z,great the first time ill see pair programming in action
jsonify,2015-01-07T00:22:16.410Z,"We've created this weekly pair programming show to help people get a feeling of what a PP session can be like. I believe tonight they'll be working through a couple CoderByte challenges, but future show will have other events like using Angular.js and recreating popular websites with HTML/CSS"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T00:25:47.396Z,@gladcoding you can hover over their name and open their github profiles

Maximization,2015-01-07T01:39:31.988Z,in the first week of M101JS they explain the difference between SQL and JSON really well
Maximization,2015-01-07T01:39:54.096Z,let's just say I'm very glad to be using JSON
Maximization,2015-01-07T01:40:16.808Z,"it's neat, clear and awesome"
xesha,2015-01-07T01:40:24.949Z,"I heard about it on a podcast, I think it was the Start Here podcast. Seemed interesting... "

benstoltz,2015-01-07T01:53:16.001Z,sql has it’s purpose just like nosql solutions like Mongo have their purpose.
cerissa,2015-01-07T01:53:48.250Z,welcome to the course @xesha  
Maximization,2015-01-07T01:54:07.484Z,"@xesha nothing wrong with SQL ;), we're just opinionated on sql vs nosql"
Maximization,2015-01-07T01:54:57.146Z,"alright, I'm going to leave the homework assignments for tomorrow"

odrisck,2015-01-07T02:36:17.886Z,"your task is to find where its set into columns, and change it"
odrisck,2015-01-07T02:36:32.258Z,with something that you have learned about how to alter css styling
DavidII,2015-01-07T02:36:45.820Z,:smile: good night my friend

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1oZhEIrer4"
mainevent,2015-01-07T02:48:00.291Z,"@odrisck ""col-md"" - it goes for ""medium""?"
RussEby,2015-01-07T02:48:06.507Z,"@sircharleswatson Thanks, that was cool. I've heard that about gardeners; the only difference between someone with a green thumb and a black thumb, is that the green thumb planted a hundred and was proud of the one that grew and the other gave up when the first plant died."
StevenKW,2015-01-07T02:53:30.475Z,Thanks for the video @sircharleswatson I hope it takes less than 5 years. :)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T02:55:21.578Z,"@StevenKW Like the video said, set deadlines and do a project every week. it will be less than 5 years :)"

jvfon,2015-01-07T02:57:25.016Z,@sircharleswatson  Great video. I needed to hear that. 
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T02:58:16.646Z,@jvfon no problem! Glad you enjoyed it :)
odrisck,2015-01-07T03:04:48.667Z,"@mainevent yes, sorry about that, it means medium devices"
mainevent,2015-01-07T03:08:03.163Z,@odrisck i've gave up.. I found col-3-md. So I can remove css attribute and this menu block should appear at the bottom of the page. Am I right?
teddy-error,2015-01-07T03:08:35.962Z,That's a cool Ira Glass animation
teddy-error,2015-01-07T03:08:41.176Z,@sircharleswatson 
odrisck,2015-01-07T03:09:53.698Z,great session
odrisck,2015-01-07T03:10:20.520Z,"oh please don't give up, you need to find where your column is identified in the css and comment it out yes"
odrisck,2015-01-07T03:10:30.589Z,so you compare your html with your css
odrisck,2015-01-07T03:10:42.364Z,My attention was split
odrisck,2015-01-07T03:11:31.911Z,"also, our help channel is https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Help and your questions are less likely to be missed there"

teddy-error,2015-01-07T03:44:57.361Z,im just here to get rich
bobderrico80,2015-01-07T03:45:05.863Z,"@sircharleswatson I am moving in that direction. I worked with PHP because I got started by doing some wordpress stuff, but in general, I find JS much easier to work with. I am looking forward to learning node.js. I completed a basic tutorial to get some routing set-up, but that is about as far as I got."
xesha,2015-01-07T03:46:30.129Z,I guess I don't know enough about programming to know why I should dislike PHP...

teddy-error,2015-01-07T03:52:09.058Z,What is the pair programming application that was used today?
xesha,2015-01-07T03:52:14.598Z,"I mean, it's my first scripting language so I'm used to it. I'm just starting Ruby and I find it a little confusing so far."

teddy-error,2015-01-07T04:17:47.703Z,There's this cool single page web app for Dota2 http://dotateam.me/ where you can basically build a team and it gives you a summary of your composition and some related statistics as well as provide suggestions for heroes to pick. I'm working on a more in-depth clone of this and was wondering if anyone was interested in collaborating either by contributing code or just strategic input
apexpred,2015-01-07T04:18:18.786Z,I just watch LoL now.
apexpred,2015-01-07T04:19:21.801Z,I would If I knew anything about dota
teddy-error,2015-01-07T04:20:49.826Z,Fair enough. I'd totally be down to add a LoL section at some point to the website

AdventureBear,2015-01-07T04:27:41.217Z,Hey I've been gone for about 5 days from here...are all the challenges reset to zero again? 
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T04:29:05.460Z,@AdventureBear They shouldnt be
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T04:29:35.031Z,ahh... OK I got it.  I guess I have 3 authorizaitons
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T04:29:50.533Z,used my plain email oen and it's where it was before @ 27 challenges (wow!)
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T04:29:57.690Z,do you use different email addresses for each?
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T04:32:11.413Z,"well I used the social media accounts. Do you mean within each social media? There are 2 basica ddreses I use. Maybe 3...oen for linked in, one for twitter & facebook and one for google. Not planned, just whatever mood I was in"
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T04:32:35.566Z,but the plain email login I used is gmail so is it odd that the gmail auth doesn't have my challenges completed?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T04:33:26.797Z,"ya, that is odd"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T04:34:21.493Z,unless you have two gmail accounts and the google auth is different than the email auth
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T04:35:15.409Z,"just one google account, well I have other gmail addresses, but I'm only logged into that main one all the time. I have some throw away ones. "
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T04:35:23.293Z,not a big deal though< we figured it out. :)

BenClist,2015-01-07T04:42:26.963Z,"the important thing to remember about coding is that you're never going to remember everything, don't be afraid to look things up"
teddy-error,2015-01-07T04:42:59.340Z,+1 @apexpred 
teddy-error,2015-01-07T04:43:19.185Z,if people can memorize decks of cards in 30 seconds i should be able to memorize css properties
apexpred,2015-01-07T04:44:44.150Z,yea you just need to type it many times to get it to stick
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T04:51:45.984Z,isn't it just inline?
apexpred,2015-01-07T04:53:47.350Z,if you set it to be inline you can't add a width or height
apexpred,2015-01-07T04:54:13.644Z,inline-block acts like inline but you can set width and height to the element
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T04:54:16.415Z,i just style the div rather than the element itself
CorainChicago,2015-01-07T04:54:28.873Z,Hello World!  A friend who I code with on projects sent me the link to FreeCodeCamp.  
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T04:54:40.897Z,@CorainChicago Welcome to FCC!
apexpred,2015-01-07T04:54:45.184Z,Welcome!
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T04:54:50.713Z,Which languages do you work on?
CorainChicago,2015-01-07T04:57:23.784Z,"Thanks!  I work in html, css/sass and Javascript.  JS is my favorite"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T04:58:46.122Z,@CorainChicago great :smile: You'll enjoy the challenges
QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T05:00:58.976Z,@CorainChicago Greetings from San Francisco!
QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T05:01:11.535Z,@AmmarAliShah @apexpred Good evening / morning!
apexpred,2015-01-07T05:01:56.791Z,12:01 yep its morning
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:02:51.768Z,@QuincyLarson Morning for me too: it's 10:02
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:02:54.348Z,AM
apexpred,2015-01-07T05:05:29.075Z,I bought a domain and launched my simple website. [davidomar.com](http://davidomar.com)
RussEby,2015-01-07T05:07:07.811Z,@apexpred Very cool! I like the smooth slide ins.
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:07:21.217Z,@apexpred nice site dude
apexpred,2015-01-07T05:07:44.998Z,Thanks guys
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:08:00.475Z,I have a .me domain but there was a problem with my hosting provider and all my data was lost
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:08:21.662Z,i'm working on a new and better site now
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:09:11.032Z,This time i will include a bit of JS
apexpred,2015-01-07T05:09:41.422Z,great I'd like to see it when its finished
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T05:10:21.934Z,@teddy-error  those people practice for years to learn to memorize cards in 30 seconds.   If you're serious about the comparison what kind of memory hooks are you using to help remember CSS? 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:10:50.756Z,:smile: 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T05:24:16.633Z,"@apexpred Great looking site! Only took me about 45 seconds to view all the content, so you’ve got some writing to do ;)"
teddy-error,2015-01-07T05:28:29.321Z,@apexpred needs more <marquee>s
apexpred,2015-01-07T05:29:43.712Z,"@QuincyLarson yea thanks, just wanted to have something up in the mean time"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T05:30:45.362Z,Move fast and break things :)
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:42:38.440Z,http://www.lynda.com/jQuery-tutorials/jQuery-Essential-Training/48370-2.html
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:42:48.355Z,I'm going to start with this soon ^
RussEby,2015-01-07T05:45:36.254Z,@AmmarAliShah I've heard good things about Lynda. You'll have to tell us your thoughts when your finished.
apexpred,2015-01-07T05:45:44.195Z,currently reading eloquent javascript.  such a nice book
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:46:10.203Z,@RussEby i've taken numerous courses at Lynda and everything you here is true
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:46:17.814Z,the courses are just amazing
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:47:02.681Z,but my favorite author has to be Simon Allardice 
RussEby,2015-01-07T05:48:49.444Z,"@AmmarAliShah With videos I like when it's possible to follow along typing the code as they're talking, some courses, have ""magic"" functions that they don't really explain. Do they show all the code to follow along?"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:51:37.319Z,@RussEby they provide you with the exercise files...the original files they work on the video are provided to us
apexpred,2015-01-07T05:52:03.339Z,how much do you have to pay for lynda?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:52:42.813Z,that is if you're a premium member
RussEby,2015-01-07T05:53:16.573Z,"@AmmarAliShah Oh, I'd rather type it in, that way I can experiment as I go along. plus typos allow for debugging practice :smile: "
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:54:55.744Z,@apexpred i don't have an account... can't afford it
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:55:06.336Z,My friend gives me his
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:55:28.799Z,@RussEby that's cool
RussEby,2015-01-07T05:57:05.537Z,"@apexpred I think Lynda is $25US a month w/o the project files, a year sub gives you a bit of a discount."
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:58:21.092Z,I don't earn anything and get 100 r.s/day from my parents
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T05:59:58.398Z,$25/month is most of allowance!
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:00:03.662Z,my*
teddy-error,2015-01-07T06:01:22.668Z,that's a lot of bacon money @AmmarAliShah 
teddy-error,2015-01-07T06:01:33.854Z,you could get at least two packages
teddy-error,2015-01-07T06:01:39.115Z,probably a pound from a butcher
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:01:52.892Z,no Bacon in Pakistan
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:02:03.527Z,it's not allowed :smile: 
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:02:45.923Z,"Wow, Don't think I could handle that. I love my bacon. Is it just bacon or all pork?"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:02:55.432Z,all pork
teddy-error,2015-01-07T06:03:39.934Z,is it because pigs are smart or because pigs are scavengers?
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:04:32.892Z,Is it religious reasons or something else?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:04:51.205Z,"it's because pigs are regarded as ""Haram(not-allowed to eat)"" in Islam and it is the ""Islamic State of Pakistan"""
teddy-error,2015-01-07T06:05:28.880Z,"laws are weird. it's illegal to text and drive here as of 2015, but it's legal to read a novel while driving"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:06:19.464Z,@teddy-error there's a whole story about pigs and why they are not halal but that's for another time
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:06:58.783Z,"Thank you for explaining, I hope you don't mind the questions."
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:07:17.909Z,@teddy-error lol
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:07:27.577Z,@RussEby i never mind
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:07:31.698Z,just ask away

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:08:32.892Z,why did you change the link?
teddy-error,2015-01-07T06:08:41.966Z,for gitter
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:09:21.240Z,"I'm at work, imgur is blocked. Along with most other fun sites. :-1: "
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:09:33.002Z,@RussEby hack it
BenClist,2015-01-07T06:09:49.435Z,"I'm at work an almost nothing is blocked, it's great :)"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:09:50.557Z,My dad isn't allowed to download stuff on his office computer
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:09:58.022Z,i hacked it for him
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:10:17.692Z,and nobody finds out because he has his own office room :smiley: 
teddy-error,2015-01-07T06:10:31.578Z,don't get ur daddy fired
odrisck,2015-01-07T06:11:21.153Z,very poor infosec if they don't know he has access to things he shouldnt
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:11:46.963Z,@odrisck i actually went did quite a few stuff
mxys,2015-01-07T06:11:51.258Z,"@AmmarAliShah A lot of libraries are starting to offer members free access to sites like Lynda. I'm not sure where you live, but you might want to look into that."
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:12:03.724Z,"The company I directly work for doesn't care, but we have our network funneled through another company's network. They care. And spend most of the time monitoring everything."
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:12:05.780Z,p.s he's the head of Security!
mxys,2015-01-07T06:12:19.601Z,My local library in Australia has free Lynda access at least
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:12:32.972Z,@mxys that's cool
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:13:10.620Z,"the library in St Paul, MN has free access to Treehouse."
BenClist,2015-01-07T06:13:14.035Z,"I've never actually been to the library here, might have to check now"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:13:43.479Z,@teddy-error he won't. He's the head of security so who'll check him
mxys,2015-01-07T06:13:57.207Z,"The library I used in the US had free Lynda too, so I think it must be pretty common now."
odrisck,2015-01-07T06:14:07.208Z,"well, if you had to hack his system for him I'm guessing he is physical security, not data security, if wherever he works isn't aware they can't see what he is doing, then they never could, hence, poor infosec :)"
BenClist,2015-01-07T06:14:24.061Z,"Yeah, but I'm in New Zealand, we're about 10 years behind on most things"
teddy-error,2015-01-07T06:14:43.753Z,i saw the lord of the rings you guys have pretty cool dragon fireworks
BenClist,2015-01-07T06:15:12.982Z,I'd rather be a Dwarf
mxys,2015-01-07T06:15:23.197Z,@BenClist Haha. That's a shame. I've been wanting to head up to New Zealand since I'm so close now. 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:16:08.058Z,@odrisck he's incharge of all security and then they have sub-heads who work under him and report to him
odrisck,2015-01-07T06:16:18.471Z,cool
BenClist,2015-01-07T06:16:21.535Z,"It's definitely worth a visit, I've only been here a few months, originally from the UK. It's very fertile ground for web work, so many businesses have either no website or something that looks like it was done in geocities"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T06:16:26.220Z,"and he didn't ask me to hack it, i just wanted to do it"

BenClist,2015-01-07T06:22:52.304Z,"morning/evening, 7pm here :)"
frankmaina,2015-01-07T06:23:15.787Z,@RussEby how are you today?
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:24:09.218Z,"Good, Except for this project my work has me doing --- Boring!! --- "
frankmaina,2015-01-07T06:24:35.812Z,@RussEby whats it about?
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:25:51.641Z,"I'm digging through, by hand, log files, looking for zeros. Unfortunately I can't automate it, don't have access. so page by page"
frankmaina,2015-01-07T06:27:53.579Z,@RussEby that has got to be tough...so what happens if you find a 0?
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:29:27.241Z,"@frankmaina Then I have to figure out why. (it's data coming off of monitoring units), So far haven't found any. If I found one then I get to solve a puzzle, now it's just scrolling through pages! Been at it about 4 hours."
iyeager2004,2015-01-07T06:30:49.486Z,I'd spend my time writing an Android app that does OCR and scan the pages with my phone. 
mxys,2015-01-07T06:31:40.640Z,@RussEby Oh no. I used to do some accounting. Had to compare reports and make sure every single number matched. Your eyes go kind of fuzzy after a while :frowning: 
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:32:17.218Z,@iyeager2004 Like for tracking receipts?
frankmaina,2015-01-07T06:32:54.953Z,Fuzzy hehe i can imagine... bearing in mind that you are actually working the night shift @RussEby 
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:33:06.679Z,"@mxys Yeah, I'm taking breaks talking on this chat room, keeps my mind from wondering too far."
RussEby,2015-01-07T06:33:55.897Z,"@frankmaina It's quiet, which doesn't help"
BenClist,2015-01-07T06:34:19.605Z,Surely if 0's are bad they should get logged separately as warnings :worried: 
frankmaina,2015-01-07T06:35:06.057Z,@BenClist Perhaps there are some good zeros..
frankmaina,2015-01-07T06:35:47.476Z,@RussEby are there?
BenClist,2015-01-07T06:36:27.883Z,would still be more efficient to log them separately. Would save having to hunt for them in the first place. Get the feeling you might be working with quite old software @RussEby ?
mxys,2015-01-07T06:40:26.634Z,I've seen so many stories on Reddit of people getting into programming just because their companies use outdated software and they want to find better solutions.
frankmaina,2015-01-07T06:48:54.637Z,Apparently git 1.9.4 for windows had a security vulnerability.. anybody know anything about it? Just wondering
teddy-error,2015-01-07T06:51:40.798Z,"An attacker can craft a malicious Git tree that will cause Git to ovewrite its own .git/config file when cloning or checking out a repository, leading to arbitrary command execution in the client machine.

Linux clients are not affected if they run in a case-sensitive filesystem. - See more at: http://blog.assembla.com/critical-git-vulnerability-announced-git-clients-update-required#sthash.kupnF5MZ.dpuf"
frankmaina,2015-01-07T06:56:29.490Z,@teddy-error thanks..heroku had kept me out just because of that issue
RussEby,2015-01-07T07:00:42.160Z,"@BenClist I'm working in the new back end. It doesn't have the reporting structure put in place yet. The end customer that wanted this is writing all the reporting stuff themselves, we act as the DB and API. They access the API to pull the data.

QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T07:24:22.589Z,@mxys welcome back! That’s precisely what got me into programming - organizational inefficiency and bad software at our school’s corporate headquarters.
QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T07:25:41.148Z,@teddy-error thanks for the heads-up! I think I installed the patch for that a couple weeks back.

Nocando,2015-01-07T07:59:12.115Z,"I really don't like reading. But, If I want to get better at javascript, I must read."

Nocando,2015-01-07T08:03:46.680Z,@alexandruolteanu I do. Why do you ask?
seahik,2015-01-07T08:04:55.242Z,"Anyone by chance able to direct me to the challenges on Codeschool's Node course?  I can watch the videos, but for the life of me, I can't find the exercises/challenges on their website."
RussEby,2015-01-07T08:15:47.948Z,"Sorry, I haven't gotten to those, The other ones in CodeSchool, the exercises were just there. Maybe it's just a set of videos?"
seahik,2015-01-07T08:21:57.534Z,I opened an incognito chrome window and now it's working.  Appararently its a known problem:
seahik,2015-01-07T08:22:57.342Z,"From *https://www.codeschool.com/support  ""Having trouble with Real-time Web with Node.js?""*
**Background**
We occasionally see users having issues loading the course assets from our AWS CloudFront account, which you can sometimes see in the DevTools Console. And if those files aren't loading properly then code submissions are likely to fail.
Some of our newer courses also use some advanced browser features for caching content and using localStorage. And furthermore we run into issues validating code when users are running Chrome Extensions (HTTPSeverywhere and Adblock in particular).
**Solution**
Try using a Chrome Incognito Window and see if that clears up your issues. It may be simply a matter of disabling your Chrome extensions and the course will work fine. Or if the issues persist then you can also try a different browser for troubleshooting purposes."
RussEby,2015-01-07T08:24:01.006Z,Good to know
seahik,2015-01-07T08:25:20.108Z,"It was just missing a little button at the bottom of the screen to switch to the challenges.  But when view the page in incognito mode, it shows up."
RussEby,2015-01-07T08:27:02.901Z,"Crazy, and I bet the developer said, ""but it works on my machine"". :smile: "
seahik,2015-01-07T08:27:12.297Z,hahaha
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:36:25.355Z,"@seahik what extensions do you have for chrome, and which ones aren’t enabled for incognito mode?"
seahik,2015-01-07T08:42:30.874Z,"i think they are all disabled in incognito?  adblock, send by gmail, google translate, norton ( :S )"
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:43:41.298Z,you may also try whitelisting codeschool in adblock
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:44:12.058Z,so that you don’t have to run incog mode
seahik,2015-01-07T08:44:53.580Z,ah ok thanks vm 
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:46:00.690Z,"np, hope it works"

bboyjacks,2015-01-07T08:48:15.256Z,Any suggestion going about understanding this?
seahik,2015-01-07T08:48:26.715Z,@terakilobyte   whitelisting codeschool fixed it!  thx again
bboyjacks,2015-01-07T08:48:34.057Z,Should I draw pictures or something
bboyjacks,2015-01-07T08:48:43.055Z,This is really confusing me
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:49:16.239Z,"@seahik :) When it comes to extensions I’m starting to adopt the philosophy that issues related to them are the user’s fault, not the developers"
seahik,2015-01-07T08:49:46.371Z,haha yes I'm sure there are many case like that.  But maybe there needs to be better reminders on websites that extensions might cause problems with their content. 
bboyjacks,2015-01-07T08:50:38.934Z,for the callbacks for maps if we put two arguments in there is the first argument the current element and the second argument the index?
bboyjacks,2015-01-07T08:51:15.413Z,"like this one 
```
var blocks = row.map(function(cell, colNum) {
      return cell.draw(widths[colNum], heights[rowNum]);
    });
```"
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:52:10.787Z,yes
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:53:01.512Z,"the callback function passed to map gets three arguments inthe following order: the current value, the index, and the containing array"
bboyjacks,2015-01-07T08:55:26.269Z,Well I'll sleep on chapter 6 maybe it will make sense in the morning
seahik,2015-01-07T08:56:10.478Z,@bboyjacks  definitely!  i have to keep reminding myself that it's much easier the 2nd or 3rd time reading it
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:56:29.215Z,it also helps to do something else every now and then
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:56:57.140Z,work on challenges that require the use of Array.prototype.map() or .filter() or anything
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T08:57:10.068Z,usage will help solidify the concept
bboyjacks,2015-01-07T08:57:18.494Z,okay thanks guys
seahik,2015-01-07T09:11:26.111Z,"@terakilobyte Hmm, I still ended up having to switch to Firefox to be able to submit the challenges on the Codeschool Node course.  I tried disable all extensions on chrome and in incognito window.  But both didn't work...strange"
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T09:13:01.201Z,You guys are talking alien. I hope I'll get it some day.
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:17:51.801Z,hiya folks
seahik,2015-01-07T09:25:01.022Z,hulllooo
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:31:32.068Z,@seahik howdy!
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T09:33:01.845Z,Hello People
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T09:33:38.521Z,I've made a very important life decision to join you in this strange practise which i yet do not understand
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:34:00.108Z,Woohoo @Kinglwal 
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:34:02.587Z,Welcome!
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T09:34:31.558Z,I'm actually heaps excited to
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T09:34:37.337Z,learn code
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T09:35:13.081Z,I'm not completely noob but i'm not intimidate yet 
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:35:50.578Z,:-) Good for you. What are you starting with? HTML? 
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T09:36:32.493Z,yeah started html around 2 days ago... was actually really easy to catch on :)
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T09:37:05.046Z,i want to learn javascript though 
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:37:42.469Z,"well, you've come to the right place! "
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T09:38:30.073Z,which language do you prefer? 
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:40:09.783Z,"My ultimate goal is to be a front-end developer. So, the very basics are a must. HTML/CSS (have a pretty good handle on), then JS and the various libraries. "
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T09:42:46.618Z,um you seem like someone whose been in the coding business for awhile?
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:44:59.588Z,I've done A LOT of research about what i want to do and how to get there the quickest. :-)
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:45:18.701Z,"Been learning web dev for about 8 months now, mostly part-time. Starting putting in FT effort in Nov."
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T09:45:47.824Z,currently going through the JS challenges here on FCC
teddy-error,2015-01-07T10:02:14.499Z,:beers: 
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T10:02:24.050Z,@mjcCodes Way to go. I've been learning programming on and off for the past year but I've never gotten too far. 
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T10:02:26.572Z,Time to be serious boot it
kiytang,2015-01-07T10:14:39.895Z,Hi fellow campers can any one explain how the border-bottom property on the .triangle (Robot Challenge.) Can't grasp the explaination provided on slide 40. Thanks in advance :)
RussEby,2015-01-07T10:22:29.785Z,@kiytang Are you referring to how they got a border to look like a triangle?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T10:23:18.440Z,@kiytang http://codepen.io/ammarshah/full/zxKPzd
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T10:23:41.698Z,Check out the code here and look at what you want to know
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T10:25:22.155Z,I'm putting up a coming soon page on my domain
RussEby,2015-01-07T10:35:22.889Z,@AmmarAliShah Is it going to be simple or are you going to put something cute/funny?
RussEby,2015-01-07T10:36:53.022Z,Maybe a hamster in a wheel? I'd put a farmer plowing a field with a cow. (Minnesota has lots of farms.)
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T10:39:51.723Z,I'm going for simple
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T10:40:13.535Z,"I'm working hard on the site rather than the ""Coming Soon"" page"
kiytang,2015-01-07T10:40:55.526Z,@RussEby yes that would really help
RussEby,2015-01-07T10:41:23.685Z,@kiytang Here's a Codepen http://codepen.io/RussEby/pen/gbgbOJ
kiytang,2015-01-07T10:41:35.007Z,@AmmarAliShah wow that very nice!
Maximization,2015-01-07T10:42:56.444Z,Good morning guys
RussEby,2015-01-07T10:43:02.510Z,Morning
kiytang,2015-01-07T10:44:34.649Z,@RussEby thats makes a lot of sense now- many thanks 
RussEby,2015-01-07T10:44:54.472Z,"@kiytang Awesome, I'm glad I could help"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T10:46:47.846Z,@kiytang thanks
kiytang,2015-01-07T10:46:50.871Z,@RussEby i just forked your pen w/out asking permission- hope you  dont mind :)
RussEby,2015-01-07T10:47:23.693Z,Go right ahead
RussEby,2015-01-07T10:48:32.061Z,I'm glad someone can find use of those pens
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T11:02:44.327Z,I have a JS question. I am creating a stopwatch app. Are there any pros-cons to using setInterval() vs setTimeout()
RussEby,2015-01-07T11:04:23.787Z,"setInterval will keep running, setTimeout will run once http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2696692/setinterval-vs-settimeout"
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T11:05:01.246Z,@RussEby Thanks. That's not exactly what I need to know. 
RussEby,2015-01-07T11:05:46.365Z,"oh .., then as in performance?"
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T11:08:32.730Z,"@RussEby Yeah, like if you've been using JS for a long time you know which method has more quirks than others or perhaps there is a ""rule of thumb"" that tells you under which condition you should use either."
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T11:08:55.060Z,"You know, I like to try to learn these things as I'm coding"
RussEby,2015-01-07T11:10:41.968Z,"Oh, like when certain things work slightly different in one browser then another."
RussEby,2015-01-07T11:11:56.133Z,I wonder if anyone started a website for JavaScript about that? I know of Caniuse but that's for HTML/CSS.
mjcCodes,2015-01-07T11:15:07.369Z,@RussEby Exactly! I like to learn these tricks as I'm learning new methods - try to keep the bad habits or unintentional errors at bay. 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T11:22:39.495Z,http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T11:24:24.277Z,@sircharleswatson followed you on twitter
RussEby,2015-01-07T11:27:25.819Z,"@mjcCodes This isn't about browser compatibilities, but it gives examples on how setIntervel can actually skip calls. very interesting. http://javascript.info/tutorial/settimeout-setinterval"
RussEby,2015-01-07T11:39:10.469Z,"Well, time for me to go, Catch you all later."

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T12:30:30.459Z,@graugott Welcome to FCC
awitherow,2015-01-07T12:30:35.418Z,"and become more proficient so that one day i can get rid of the ""junior"" tag :)"
awitherow,2015-01-07T12:30:43.822Z,thanks @AmmarAliShah 
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T12:30:59.059Z,Where do you work?
awitherow,2015-01-07T12:31:15.260Z,"I'm in Germany, at Goodgamestudios."

awitherow,2015-01-07T12:33:08.037Z,and yes! that's one of them... empire is more popular though.
Maximization,2015-01-07T12:33:54.723Z,you guys are working with java?
awitherow,2015-01-07T12:35:07.460Z,"There is a Java Core team, yes."
serhiicss,2015-01-07T12:36:06.040Z,@cerissa same here!
Maximization,2015-01-07T12:36:17.738Z,"ah ok, what frameworks are you working with in your team?"

awitherow,2015-01-07T12:36:57.293Z,Currently just developing everything with Javascript and jQuery on the frontend.
Maximization,2015-01-07T12:37:48.697Z,"cool, from what I can see on the website sounds like a great company to work for"
awitherow,2015-01-07T12:38:16.686Z,It's quite rad.
Maximization,2015-01-07T12:39:46.056Z,"oh wait, you guys have also made Age of Empires Online"

awitherow,2015-01-07T12:46:47.816Z,"you guys got any ideas for some ""practice projects""?"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T12:47:09.508Z,@graugott do you do python?
awitherow,2015-01-07T12:47:31.023Z,"strictly frontend stuff right now, but would love to get into other languages."
awitherow,2015-01-07T12:47:35.107Z,"so yes, python is good :)"
awitherow,2015-01-07T12:48:42.471Z,"i'd rather though stick with mainly javascript and get great at that, since most of my job/career is focused around frontend at the moment."
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T12:49:47.433Z,@graugott i know a website that gives you challenges and the language is Python
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T12:50:00.480Z,it's a good thing to practice Python
awitherow,2015-01-07T12:50:20.425Z,yeah sure that'd be cool!

Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:04:05.144Z,Does anyone know a good site with tutorials for learning jQuery?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:07:06.943Z,@Iulius90 are you ready to pay?
Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:07:54.621Z,depends on how much
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:08:28.303Z,if you can afford it: http://www.lynda.com/default.aspx
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:08:42.061Z,One of the best I've ever seen
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:08:54.790Z,and they have a large number of courses
Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:09:41.608Z,have you tried teamtreehouse? how are they in comparison? 
serhiicss,2015-01-07T13:10:10.185Z,@Iulius90 codeschool is part of FCC roadmap
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:10:10.352Z,@Iulius90 sorry haven't tried treehouse
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:10:23.101Z,@Iulius90 just go along with FCC
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:10:27.043Z,you'll learn it
Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:10:53.143Z,@AmmarAliShah thnk you
Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:10:58.246Z,thank you
serhiicss,2015-01-07T13:11:06.414Z,"teamtreehouse is very nice, they have a free 14 day trial I think"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:11:23.085Z,@Iulius90 You're welcome
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T13:11:24.643Z,"Yess, just stick with the FCC curriculum and check out the free resources that are posted in here often"

Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:12:40.116Z,any thoughts on codecademy?
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:12:57.480Z,@Iulius90 i liked it
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T13:13:00.900Z,"Yeah, treehouse is pretty cool"
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T13:13:08.757Z,"Did everything relate do html, css & js over there"
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T13:13:16.038Z,But I switched over here for the projects
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:13:34.262Z,@Iulius90 codexademy was good for jQuery
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:13:48.131Z,easier than codeschool :smiley: 
Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:14:06.200Z,I did the html and css course back there 
Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:14:22.623Z,they wore very simple to understand but pretty basic
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:14:50.893Z,"@Iulius90 i would say follow FCC, you'll learn everything you need"
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:15:16.441Z,after you are done here then move along to advance paid courses but that won't be needed i guess
Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:15:59.158Z,ok
Iulius90,2015-01-07T13:16:00.501Z,thanks
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T13:16:42.745Z,you're welcome
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T13:17:03.367Z,"More like ""after you are done here move to actual projects and practice practice practice"""
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T13:17:07.423Z,1000 courses will do you no good

Nocando,2015-01-07T13:41:35.281Z,Nice
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:41:54.904Z,"If you don't mind me asking, how did you get their two year scholarships"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T13:41:57.827Z,"Nice @seahik. Well the semester starts today so I have three classes to go to, but aside from that reading for them and then programming."
Phonbopit,2015-01-07T13:42:02.459Z,@seahik I purchased theme from themeforest 
benstoltz,2015-01-07T13:42:44.316Z,@Nocando About two years ago they put out a series of blog articles inviting college students to apply for a 2 year scholarship. I think I was in the first 10/20 students to apply? 
benstoltz,2015-01-07T13:43:15.809Z,"I could have done more with it, but I’ve done….quite a lot."
seahik,2015-01-07T13:43:38.640Z,"@Phonbopit ah i hadn't heard of that site, interesting thx"
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:44:41.783Z,I see. That's great. I wish they could do those scholarships now
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:45:29.755Z,"Sometimes I feel like rushing through these challenges. But, I don't think they would do me any good..."
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T13:51:20.723Z,@Nocando and @alexandruolteanu please pm me your email address associated with your screenhero account
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T13:51:27.487Z,and we can begin pairing
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T13:51:43.196Z,"if you don’t have screenhero please find their website and download the program, then immediately upgrade to the beta"
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T13:51:54.604Z,you do not need to subscribe
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:53:00.830Z,At the moment I can't screen pair. My nap schedule is coming up very soon.
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:53:10.469Z,"But, I'll email you"
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T13:53:54.448Z,ok
benstoltz,2015-01-07T13:54:00.469Z, /sobs I wish I had a nap schedule
benstoltz,2015-01-07T13:54:05.953Z,lol
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:54:23.921Z,lol
seahik,2015-01-07T13:54:26.863Z,ha yeah you sound really busy!
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:54:37.337Z,I'm trying to recover from my all-nighters....
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T13:54:49.884Z,naps are amazing
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T13:54:55.470Z,we fought them at 5
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T13:55:03.800Z,didn’t think much of them at 15
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:55:09.650Z,Anyone here play Sim City: Build It?
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T13:55:11.279Z,and they become coveted at 25
benstoltz,2015-01-07T13:55:13.543Z,I have at minimum 120 - 160 pages per week of academic reading this semester…—_— That I have to read well enough to discuss.
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:57:14.653Z,"Ah, good luck! I start my semester on monday"
Nocando,2015-01-07T13:57:39.618Z,I'm a freshman xD
benstoltz,2015-01-07T13:58:02.816Z,What will you be studying?
seahik,2015-01-07T13:58:56.163Z,@terakilobyte ha so true
benstoltz,2015-01-07T13:59:27.035Z,Oh man….you guys following what happened in France?
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T13:59:39.006Z,@terakilobyte I'm at work for two more hours but I PM'ed you anyways 
Nocando,2015-01-07T14:00:36.114Z,My wifi just went crazy on me! 
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:01:10.542Z,"@benstoltz I'm reading about it, holy shit"
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:01:34.568Z,"Ak-47 and RPG's, what the heck"
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:01:46.982Z,sounds like a movie scene
Nocando,2015-01-07T14:01:56.338Z,Are we talking about Charlie H?
benstoltz,2015-01-07T14:02:21.751Z,"A Paris newspaper got attacked today, 12 people dead thereabouts"
Nocando,2015-01-07T14:07:13.394Z,"I don't know why I said Charlie H. But, I'm on the right article."
benstoltz,2015-01-07T14:07:32.301Z,Yeah
seahik,2015-01-07T14:08:54.266Z,"oh that's tragic...I wonder why they didn't have undisclosed locations of their offices or work remotely, since there was a history of attacks/threats"
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:13:16.215Z,"because giving into fear is a sign of capitulation. All this will do is provoke more of what the attackers claimed to hate, at the very least. My opinion anyway"
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:16:04.037Z,^
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:16:07.402Z,"> Footage shot by an eyewitness apparently from the attack shows two armed men dressed in black approach a wounded police officer lying on a pavement. One of the men shot the officer in the head, before both men were seen running back towards a black vehicle and driving away."
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:16:08.513Z,sick
Nocando,2015-01-07T14:17:14.811Z,Sounds like a movie....
seahik,2015-01-07T14:18:23.629Z,@terakilobyte ah yes possibly true...but I think there is power and protection in anonymity especially on a massive scale.  Why not have tons of remote journalists all posting similar content?   Not that I necessarily know or support what they were publishing.  
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:18:40.775Z,there most likely will be
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T14:18:46.529Z,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEJch-D3ev8
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T14:18:49.915Z,Not for the faint of heart
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:19:04.181Z,"and depending on how the public sentiment is in france, the response will be much more violent"
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:19:20.787Z,this is a tragedy that could spiral into more tragedies
Nocando,2015-01-07T14:21:39.041Z,That's crazy!!
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:23:31.160Z,the comments in that video illustrate my point
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:26:12.461Z,I disagree with the hate bearing comments
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:26:56.873Z,as do I
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:27:25.355Z,"sadly though, caught up in the moment many may not"
seahik,2015-01-07T14:27:27.035Z,off to do some errands.  see ya all later...stay safe :/
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:29:52.744Z,"anyway, back to development. @Nocando I’m still waiting on you to accept my contact request so we can pair"
tusharkhatiwada,2015-01-07T14:30:20.397Z,Hello Everyone !!
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:30:33.884Z,@tusharkhatiwada hello
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T14:30:49.762Z,@tusharkhatiwada Howdy!
tusharkhatiwada,2015-01-07T14:31:39.257Z,I recently joined the Free Code Camp. And learning a lot of stuffs. Am feeling great. :)
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:32:27.731Z,"@tusharkhatiwada excellent, glad you are finding it enjoyable. Is that your personal website in your profile?"
tusharkhatiwada,2015-01-07T14:32:45.886Z,Anyone have done the CSS Robot challenge ?
Nocando,2015-01-07T14:33:28.264Z,"@terakilobyte Is it fine if we pair later today. There's someone still sleeping in the room  that I share. Would like to use my mic instead of typing. Also, my schedule is coming up in a few minutes."
benstoltz,2015-01-07T14:33:30.680Z,"Affirmative, what’s up @tusharkhatiwada?"
tusharkhatiwada,2015-01-07T14:33:47.433Z,@terakilobyte It's a Web Design Agency I'm trying to run :). Not the one I code it myself. Used a template. But learning to do it on my own.
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:34:54.131Z,@tusharkhatiwada :) it looks pretty good. I hope you find a lot of success. What are your questions on the robot?
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:35:04.276Z,"@Nocando ok, no worries"
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:36:30.737Z,ooh just checked my email to see the mongo university course has started. Should be a fun 6 weeks
tusharkhatiwada,2015-01-07T14:36:39.107Z,"@terakilobyte At the End of the CSS Robot challenge, making the eyes blinking... Instead of the two eyes blinking, I got to manage only one eye blinking ( a big eye at the center). Did I do something wrong?"
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:37:08.457Z,"ah, a lot of people run into that issue :)"
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:37:15.932Z,@terakilobyte everyone was talking about it last night
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:37:33.530Z,@Maximization talking about what?
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:37:36.289Z,we're a group of 10 or so from FCC who enrolled
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:37:40.125Z,oh
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:37:41.629Z,great
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:37:48.520Z,I finished the first week this morning
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:37:50.959Z,we should do some collaboration on it
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:38:13.872Z,sure
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:38:20.571Z,@tusharkhatiwada go ahead and share your code and if not myself someone else can point out the issue
grafol,2015-01-07T14:38:32.869Z,morning
Nocando,2015-01-07T14:38:48.514Z,"@terakilobyte Great, I'll accept it. Ill message you later in the day when I'm available.
Ill see you guys later!"
tusharkhatiwada,2015-01-07T14:39:04.795Z,OK.
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:39:05.455Z,@Nocando take care
serhiicss,2015-01-07T14:39:10.060Z,"For the MongoDB course, how important to know JS?"
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:39:11.433Z,@tusharkhatiwada add `background: 75px 150px;` to all transition blocks
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:39:27.296Z,@serhiicss basic JS will go a long way
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:39:54.470Z,@serhiicss for mongo itself not a lot of knowledge is required. For node you may need to know more but others can help shore you up quickly
serhiicss,2015-01-07T14:40:52.216Z,"Ok. I will try it out. If too hard, I will pass."
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:40:53.770Z,"@tusharkhatiwada they forget to mention that into the lessons, but what you basically did in the main div style do create 2 eyes instead of one you have to repeat for all the animation codes"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:41:11.338Z,http://www.gradient-animator.com/
serhiicss,2015-01-07T14:41:43.205Z,"It is a modification, a more powerful single laser instead of two :)"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:42:21.102Z,Also this handy tool: http://jeremyckahn.github.io/stylie/
tusharkhatiwada,2015-01-07T14:43:50.151Z,"@Maximization http://codepen.io/tusharkhatiwada/pen/vEgOeX

This is what I am getting. "
mxys,2015-01-07T14:45:03.603Z,"Just catching up... If I have zero experience with node.js, will the MondoDB course be a bit over my head?"
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:45:21.568Z,"@tusharkhatiwada right, so you'll need to add some code to all the keyframe blocks"
terakilobyte,2015-01-07T14:45:50.048Z,"@mxys only one way to find out, and again we’re all here to help"
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:45:58.675Z,same code that you have in the .brain class to resize the background so that it has two eyes
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:46:36.390Z,@terakilobyte are you subscribed to the mongodb uni? or where did you get the email from?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:46:36.467Z,"@mxys It won't be over your head. You might not understand it all, but you can still go through it"
tusharkhatiwada,2015-01-07T14:47:04.278Z,@Maximization That's great. Thank you. Worked ! :+1: 
Maximization,2015-01-07T14:47:23.242Z,you're welcome
mxys,2015-01-07T14:48:10.670Z,@terakilobyte Good point :laughing: I'll look into it
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T14:49:17.335Z,Hey everyone.
serhiicss,2015-01-07T14:49:25.116Z,@CinnamonB Hello!
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T14:49:35.279Z,Hey @serhiicss 
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T14:50:44.683Z,"I wanted to mention about the MongoDB course, I reached out to find out about the timeline. They stated that the course runs every 10 weeks. That also gives you the option whether to start it now, or continue the challenges and wait for the course to start over again. "
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T14:51:03.427Z,I personally think 10 weeks is a bit long :laughing: of a waiting period
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:51:16.777Z,The course itself is 7 weeks
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:51:21.604Z,so there is a 3 week break
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T14:51:37.865Z,"Yes, still a long time."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:51:51.851Z,"well, you gotta give them some admin time :P"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:51:57.656Z,they do have jobs ;)
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T14:52:23.923Z,"By the time I get through the challenges, it'll be way before this month course ends lmaoo"
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T14:52:43.326Z,"We only have to do W1 of the stanford course, right?"
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:53:02.950Z,"@alexandruolteanu no, you'll do the other weeks as well"
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T14:53:20.626Z,"Ah, yeah. I just pressed next and realised. Thanks"
kstoutt,2015-01-07T14:53:24.494Z,Hello World! I am new to this site. and I look forward to learning with all of you. 
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:53:34.845Z,Welcome to FCC @kstoutt 
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:54:33.911Z,Question.....Were the SQL challenges removed from FCC?
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:54:42.381Z,@metalhaze yes
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:54:57.249Z,oooooooooooookkk
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:54:58.768Z,haha
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:55:01.376Z,lol
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-07T14:55:22.464Z,I learned that yesterday too
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:55:29.711Z,What was the verdict that lead to that decision?
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-07T14:55:38.345Z,I think because it has no place in the MEAN stack
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:55:40.302Z,MongoDB === NoSQL
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:55:52.706Z,ah
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-07T14:55:56.787Z,But also because nobody liked the stanford course on them
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:56:01.551Z,haha
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-07T14:56:03.691Z,there were complaints
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:56:04.032Z,it was really hard
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T14:56:08.818Z,Lol
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:56:33.965Z,"I got halfway through the first set of questions and I was like ""good god!"""
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T14:56:41.660Z,lol
serhiicss,2015-01-07T14:56:58.684Z,I'm so happy I took Stanford CS101 back in September. 1 more thing to scratch off the list :)
metalhaze,2015-01-07T14:57:46.016Z,Just a heads up....removing that SQL course crossed off a course I never completed
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T14:58:17.677Z,"I just did a lightweight sql course on treehouse, I think that's enough for the moment."
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:02:30.976Z,There is also a free edX course Introduction to Linux that just started https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-2#.VK1KI3aUeAk
Maximization,2015-01-07T15:04:08.497Z,@serhiicss I was interested in this one as well but backed off after reading the reviews
Maximization,2015-01-07T15:04:32.670Z,"Seemed like it doesn't really go in-depth, just scratches the surface"
Maximization,2015-01-07T15:05:15.182Z,but then again it's called Introduction to Linux so it fits the title
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:05:33.830Z,"@Maximization Well, I am new to Linux, so I am taking it :)"
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:06:34.487Z,"I will pass on MongoDB course this time and will take it next time it is up. I want to learn everything, but I don't have so much time."
Maximization,2015-01-07T15:08:05.456Z,you're the best person to make that decision
cerissa,2015-01-07T15:08:45.857Z,"@serhiicss i love linux, i dont have my own computer, i borrow someone elses computer during the day, and thinking about running a live linux distro on the comp. on time to time. what is your favorite distro?   i found bodhi linux and love it. "
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:11:47.085Z,@cerissa I think I am falling in love with Linux too! I am currently on Mint 17 Cinamon
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T15:13:31.014Z,@serhiicss That makes me want icecream
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:13:44.688Z,lol
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:14:32.516Z,"I think Linux is very good for a web developer. However, later, when I have money, I will get a macbook."
cerissa,2015-01-07T15:14:43.130Z,"i like mint also, i used it for a  few months last year,"
cerissa,2015-01-07T15:15:03.970Z,"yea same here i love linux, but i want a macbook when i get enough money, "
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T15:15:37.498Z,"Even I who's a PC fanboy will probably get a mac sometime in the next 1-2 years, haha"
greg-js,2015-01-07T15:15:43.755Z,"I'm running ubuntu, and yeah you can run a live linux distro, make a usb stick with persistent data storage"
mxys,2015-01-07T15:16:17.139Z,Has anyone started on the jQuery exercises for FCC (#15 in the list)? Having trouble with exercise 0... :x
apexpred,2015-01-07T15:16:20.485Z,I recently switched to elementaryOS. Beautiful distro
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T15:16:45.196Z,Have you guys heard of ZorinOS? It's exactly like windows but it's Linux!
apexpred,2015-01-07T15:16:55.448Z,yea
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:16:56.975Z,@apexpred I read it is a very nice distro
mwsteb,2015-01-07T15:17:18.643Z,'exactly like windows but linux!' hehe
greg-js,2015-01-07T15:17:21.436Z,Sounds interesting but why would you want it exactly like windows though? Why not just use windows then?
cerissa,2015-01-07T15:17:33.256Z,"yes i have, i have not used it, but i was hoping when i fixed my mom and step dads desktop computer they would let me put it on but they wont,  heard its pretty nice distro"
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:17:37.296Z,Command line?
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T15:17:46.804Z,@wdgreg Command line
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-07T15:18:00.462Z,"Or make the transition smoother for some people, idk"
greg-js,2015-01-07T15:18:17.494Z,Hmm yeah I guess if you really can't leave the windows look and feel
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:18:19.658Z,"Although, there is a nice command line for windows"
serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:18:34.311Z,called cmder I think

apexpred,2015-01-07T15:20:58.331Z,You guys think it's worth to buy a used MacBook?
admhlt,2015-01-07T15:21:05.126Z,"@serhiicss For WIndows there's also Console2, which isn't bad"
cerissa,2015-01-07T15:22:08.159Z,"i think it is, @apexpred  thats probably what ill do, though i might buy new but i dont know. as long as you can test it out first i dont see why it wouldnt be worth it"

serhiicss,2015-01-07T15:24:14.989Z,@admhlt Most of folks on reddit/webdev recommend it.

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T16:05:20.908Z,@admhlt don't have one
metalhaze,2015-01-07T16:06:28.316Z,What is this codeschool crap....ugh....gotta cram my Node stuff into 2 days
metalhaze,2015-01-07T16:06:34.972Z,not cool man!
metalhaze,2015-01-07T16:06:36.049Z,haha
metalhaze,2015-01-07T16:06:55.488Z,Codeschool better be paying you for the traffic haha
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T16:09:00.101Z,@metalhaze codecademy was better according to me
metalhaze,2015-01-07T16:10:35.025Z,Btw....The link on FCC to the Node.js course on Codeschool is either outdated or has some issue.....when you click the link it takes you to the right page but all the content is missing. I had to navigate to the course manually on their site for it to appear correctly @QuincyLarson

admhlt,2015-01-07T16:13:20.945Z,"Source Code Pro is nice as well, for sure.
I've been testing fonts for my company's documentation and I really like Source Sans Pro"
JimBry,2015-01-07T16:15:39.432Z,Anyone else notice that the Try jQuery track in Codeschool doesn't save the code you made after completing the whole course. 
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-07T16:19:13.592Z,"yeah man, that’s the worst when you’re trying to help someone"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-07T16:19:32.489Z,codecademy definitely wins in that category
JimBry,2015-01-07T16:27:09.089Z,"Seriously, I wonder why they do that."
metalhaze,2015-01-07T16:33:36.780Z,Is it bad that am bouncing up and down on my yoga ball chair giddy with excitement after learning about how node.js is non-blocking? haha

iheartkode,2015-01-07T16:37:20.059Z,https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com  is the entire curriculum from a bootcamp in Oregon... it has JS and mostly Ruby but it's a good resource..

zerhackermann,2015-01-07T17:35:54.746Z,howdy all. just blazed through the first few lessons
metalhaze,2015-01-07T17:36:11.209Z,I am on 2.4 with the Node stuff now
metalhaze,2015-01-07T17:36:20.063Z,starting to get a little trickier
zerhackermann,2015-01-07T17:36:27.270Z,way to go
trisell,2015-01-07T17:36:42.879Z,Node is making my brain hurt.
zerhackermann,2015-01-07T17:37:46.553Z,I've been software testing and hacking at code for a long time. But never really sat down to disciplined learning to code
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T17:37:48.988Z,@trisell glad to hear I’m not alone in the brain hurting department. I agree. But it is reassuring that it’s not just me!
trisell,2015-01-07T17:40:22.811Z,"I'm just trying to understand how to use it. It's a conceptual thing for me. One I get that I will be good to go. But right now I have no conception....so I don't have any understanding...It's the same with programming... I understand how to program...but I don't understand how to conceptually make all the pieces work together to make a program...
"
zerhackermann,2015-01-07T17:41:19.811Z,"keep digging away at it. or take a break and come back to it. but eventually there will be an ""Ah-ha!"" and it will work...and then it wont. and repeat :D then you wont use it for a couple months and then you will come back and say ""WTH? I thought I knew this?"" o"
jenthebest,2015-01-07T17:41:25.960Z,@trisell I am also working on bridging that gap...
trisell,2015-01-07T17:41:58.893Z,ps I might have made up some words there. ;D
zerhackermann,2015-01-07T17:42:01.009Z,"thats the difficult part, balancing the design with accomplishing the task. "
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T17:43:05.074Z,"I agree. Conceptualization is the tough part. I understand the bigger picture, but putting the pieces together isn’t always clear. For the last couple of years I tried learning to code off and on not realizing that my experience was normal (sometimes it was very discouraging). I just keep reminding myself that I don’t have to understand it all, and that just plugging along does make a difference."
trisell,2015-01-07T17:43:38.383Z,"In the mean time I play Kerbal Space Program to take my mind off of it. :D
"
zerhackermann,2015-01-07T17:43:57.296Z,alright back into it for me
admhlt,2015-01-07T17:45:02.991Z,@trisell I think grasping concepts is definitely the hardest part. I had to learn about REST recently for work and initially it seemed overwhelming. It was hard to grasp what I was even reading about.
williamnoon,2015-01-07T17:45:34.424Z,"@sircharleswatson  Thanks for the video just seeing it, great reminder!!"
admhlt,2015-01-07T17:45:51.275Z,"And oftentimes I'll find a new app or service someone is raving about, visit the website and think to myself 'what does this even DO?'"
trisell,2015-01-07T17:48:37.063Z,"My frustration is that I will go to github...Look at a project, and have no idea how to even begin to read the code, to figure out what it does....because I don't understand the proper way to make a large program that is more then two functions that make a dog bark when you say dog...
"
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T17:53:57.406Z,@admhlt you mean there isn’t a magical boundary to be crossed where everything becomes quick to grasp?!
admhlt,2015-01-07T17:54:21.355Z,"If there is, I ain't crossed it yet :)"
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T17:55:28.336Z,Last night I went to a local Haskell meetup and it was reassuring to hear long-time imperative programmers referring to the difficulties that have or had with learning functional programming. It sounds a lot like I feel most days lately (be it imperative or functional)!
admhlt,2015-01-07T17:56:11.474Z,"@trisell Think of it like a verbal language. You can learn a few words and phrases and be able to say a few things, and then hear a conversation between native speakers and not understand a single word. It takes a lot of time, practice, and exposure to a language to become fluent. That applies to programming too I imagine."
jsonify,2015-01-07T17:56:25.146Z,@brndnb i have no idea what you just said
jsonify,2015-01-07T17:56:26.586Z,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T17:58:38.870Z,"@admhlt I sure hope fluency is easier to achieve in computer language than human langauge. Langauges have never come easy for me. I’ve always thought it would be wonderful to dream in a different language, so maybe that language will be javascript."

brandenbyers,2015-01-07T17:59:04.483Z,@phlacin You mean you haven’t been introduced the awesome world of functional programming?

iyeager2004,2015-01-07T18:00:26.650Z,Stuck on that stupid Look Say Sequence. I'm taking a break for now. 
williamnoon,2015-01-07T18:00:29.079Z,"@admhlt Great Analogy,  With languages (I speak 4)  you get to the point of fluency once you can think in the language and no longer have to translate in your head.  "

brandenbyers,2015-01-07T18:03:04.205Z,@phlacin probably better that way. I find myself way to distracted by FP when what I need to learn to get a job isn’t that.
williamnoon,2015-01-07T18:03:15.188Z,"spanish, french, arabic and english"
iyeager2004,2015-01-07T18:03:35.730Z,@metalhaze @phlacin @admhlt Thanks all.
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T18:04:01.724Z,@williamnoon have languages always come easy to you? Do you find it to be the same in picking up computer languages?
williamnoon,2015-01-07T18:07:47.822Z,@brndnb  exactly the same with computer languages - exposure and immersion are key
williamnoon,2015-01-07T18:08:32.982Z,thanks Rosetta Stone lol
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T18:10:37.573Z,Hmm…maybe I should stop speaking English for a while except for the occasional string. Full immersion javascript.
williamnoon,2015-01-07T18:14:12.174Z,"when I targeted a language I would read its newspapers and magazines, listen to the music not understanding a single word and  i would go and place myself around native speakers."
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T18:16:07.657Z,"Now that you mention that, I guess I do that with computer languages too. I listen to quite a few coding podcasts, and sometimes they are over my head, but if what you’re saying is true, it must have some effect whether I know it or not."
williamnoon,2015-01-07T18:17:30.408Z,"it think it does, I would even have the music on while i slept"
williamnoon,2015-01-07T18:23:46.583Z,"actual conversing in a language brings the skill of fluency, the exposure and immersion in the language supports being able to communicate.   so i think that reading blogs about javascript talking about it with you guys and listening to podcast support being able to write code and converse with the browser lol"
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T18:27:40.975Z,"Makes sense. It’s the conversing part that probably makes it easier for me to learn javascript than Spanish, Thai, Japanese, or Croatian (tried them all). When conversing with real people in a foreign langauge, I get self-conscious. When conversing with the browser, as you say, I don’t have to worry about being self-conscious."
williamnoon,2015-01-07T18:30:59.536Z,man you hit the nail on the head - its all about confidence!  which was very challenging for me and still is at times depending on who im speaking to but now after i do speak im remimded that I can. So I guess we just have to remember that We Can
williamnoon,2015-01-07T18:31:53.469Z,"Has anyone been able to click on the button that says:  ""I've finished all the Free Code Camp challenges and all the Easy and Medium CoderByte challenges"""

odrisck,2015-01-07T18:34:32.252Z,"Hey @AdventureBear good to see you, how was your trip?"
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T18:35:32.952Z,"speaking of all this fluency stuff, there was a recent study done where they put programmers in an MRI and showed them bits of code and checked to see what parts of their brain lit up. They found it was more similar to language than the ""math"" which is what a lot of non-coders equate programming to. "
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T18:35:52.683Z,"@odrisck  it was really good, a few days in florida, now back in the cold"
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T18:37:51.865Z,@AdventureBear interesting. I wonder if these were only commercial programmers or also included programmers in academia? Because some of those academia types are pretty much programming in calculus.
trisell,2015-01-07T18:38:27.416Z,Bah...Stupid Code School is broken...
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T18:38:37.408Z,"Also, I wonder how they compare to mathemeticians? Because I figure at some point, for working mathemeticians, it must be more like language than it is for someone studying math in school."
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T18:39:03.234Z,@trisell broken?
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T18:39:32.030Z,"lol, i don't know if it was that specific in who the subjects were but it did discuss the limitations of the study...they wre short ""paragraphs"" of pretty simple code and they were asked to read it and figure out what it does.  They acknolwedge that that was a different part of coding than learning to code, etc.   Nevertheless pretty interesting that they are looking at that kind of stuff, how the brain responds to programming tasks.

williamnoon,2015-01-07T19:01:57.006Z,@metalhaze  @AdventureBear   Great Job!!
iyeager2004,2015-01-07T19:10:22.197Z,"@AdventureBear Thanks for that page, hadn't seen it yet. Nor had I seen the non-profit trello yet. I totally call dibs on the Marin Symphony. I've already got tickets to their Star Trek goes Symphony in June.  Their office is like, three miles from my front door. "
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T19:11:33.056Z,I like the Symphony project too! I think their needs sound really unique.  I think @QuincyLarson  said it'd be 2 ppl to a project but I'd be worried 2 isn't enough since we're all doing this part time ish. 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T19:12:56.828Z,@AdventureBear The problem with adding more people is the communication gets a lot more complicated. Think group projects back in school. Usually just one or two of the people end up doing a lion’s share of the work. That’s my one big concern about having teams larger than 2 people.
QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T19:13:08.682Z,It’s OK for these projects to take a while - none of them are time-sensitive
iyeager2004,2015-01-07T19:13:21.736Z,"Yeah, there's a lot there, but it seems like it could be done in phases. Pretty easy break points in there I think. Start with the management side to meet an immediate need than slowly add some customer (artist) facing content."
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T19:13:55.181Z,well I am hurrying through the challenges so I can get to some of the nonprofit ideas and get some real hands on practice
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T19:14:06.154Z,"not hurrying, jus ttrying to maintain forward progress"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T19:14:44.041Z,"@AdventureBear Yes, the challenges are meant to be blown through. I suspect most of the real learning will happen with the nonprofits."

QuincyLarson,2015-01-07T19:15:37.443Z,@odrisck let me know if you want to pair program to kick start those coderbyte challenges. They’re definitely more fun with a friend ;)
odrisck,2015-01-07T19:15:51.808Z,"oh absolutely, I don't intend to do them alone :)"
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T19:16:07.740Z,@QuincyLarson The perfectionist in me doesn’t like to blow through challenges. I think that has been holding me back; not jumping to the next step of learning before fully grasping the previous subject matter.
iyeager2004,2015-01-07T19:17:06.991Z,"The coderbyte challenges were weird to me. I would've assumed it would get tougher as you go on, but some are easier than others, and my buddy and I finished up the last ten or twelve this morning on the mediums and they went from pretty easy to startingly difficult. But than again, I wasn't content with an answer that missed even one edge case, and I wanted optimized code, not 18 for loops."

Scripore,2015-01-07T19:51:29.410Z,have you used Anki to assist in learning programming?
mwsteb,2015-01-07T19:52:18.582Z,"Yeah, I've used it while learning chinese"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T19:52:34.494Z,and never failed a single test
mwsteb,2015-01-07T19:52:57.723Z,"I tried it when I was learning ruby, but I lacked discipline"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T19:53:34.160Z,and the cards were much more more of a hassle
Scripore,2015-01-07T19:54:19.137Z,"oh, the last time I had used Anki was back in high school."
mwsteb,2015-01-07T19:54:21.680Z,"as I had to think through each and every one, trying to simplify it as much as possible.  "
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T19:55:15.866Z,@Scripore i'm in High School!
Scripore,2015-01-07T19:56:11.864Z,"ah, you do look young."
crosscris,2015-01-07T19:57:54.893Z,@scripore I put tidbits of my code in anki
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:00:08.462Z,And Node.js on CodeSchool just jumped 17 miles ahead with the 5.2 challenges....this is going to be confusing as hell....
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:00:08.947Z,http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html is an interesting method for learning development with Anki
Scripore,2015-01-07T20:00:26.878Z,"cool, looks like this guy has his Anki decks for Ruby and JS available on his website. I'll probably download Anki again later to check them out. http://sivers.org/srs"
seahik,2015-01-07T20:02:57.644Z,"@metalhaze  i had really tough time with node on codeschool ...doesn't help that I'm not much of an audio learner.  I think I prefer codeacademy's style.. read a little, do a little.   Now starting another 5 lessons on codeschool for Express :("
AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T20:03:14.863Z,Good Night

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-07T20:03:27.460Z,It's 1:03 AM here!
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:05:37.886Z,"@metalhaze i'm at the 3rd level for now, it's cool to use servers at level this low (though admittedly still pretty far away from the metal) after playing with web apps for a while"
cerissa,2015-01-07T20:05:57.394Z,"hey yall, have a question on html, if im making navagation links, should i use the ul li tags in the nav tag or is the nav tag ok to use without the list tags?"
seahik,2015-01-07T20:06:06.593Z,@Scripore ah thats great...would be awesome to find more already created flashcards
Scripore,2015-01-07T20:06:41.116Z,yeah
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:06:49.157Z,@seahik Thanks for the tip! I will have to do the ones on codecademy next
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:07:42.897Z,@metalhaze okay so i manage to fix the first issue 
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:08:03.092Z,:+1: 
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:08:38.651Z,"Now i got a problem. While using CSS i'm trying to change the position of one picture 
<style>
"
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T20:08:38.978Z,@cerissa Doesn’t matter really. Personal preference?
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:08:50.037Z,but it keeps changing the position for all pictures

 img { background position: top;
}"
cerissa,2015-01-07T20:09:55.553Z,thanks @brndnb 
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:10:03.091Z,background position needs a hypen
AdventureBear,2015-01-07T20:10:11.212Z,argh! Crashed my browser again! lol
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:10:11.325Z,`background-position`
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:10:58.425Z,"oh yeah i know that just forgot to put in, but my question is how do i change the position of each picture separately? do i have to place a id for each picture"
seahik,2015-01-07T20:10:59.079Z,"@metalhaze ah no sorry I don't think codecademy has Node tutorials.  However I have heard that the lessons on [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) are easier to follow.
I just meant that I liked codeacademy's teaching method better."
Scripore,2015-01-07T20:11:14.761Z,"found this deck through one of the above links
https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/490744079"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:12:15.377Z,@Kinglwal You give each photo a class or you use more specific CSS selectors
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:12:45.874Z,umm a class? sorry not quit sure what a class is yet?
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:12:53.437Z,sorry i'm new to this
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:13:12.071Z,quite**
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:13:29.843Z,same as an ID. it is a way to identify something. Each element can only have one ID but an element can have multiple classes
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:13:50.452Z,"`<div class=""myClassName""></div>`"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:14:10.756Z,"instead of 
`<div id=""myIDName""></div>`"
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:14:39.836Z,so i must always include a <div> </div>
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:14:46.825Z,"but you can also have 
`<div class=""this that these those myName hisName""></div>`"
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T20:16:01.258Z,"What is the best way to make a website fully responsive? I've been using Foundation as a crutch and I'm thinking it would be best to handle all the responsiveness myself, but not sure where to start."
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:16:10.724Z,"@Kinglwal A DIV isn't always required but it is the building blocks of HTML layout.....General rule of thumb should be that anytime you put something on the screen, you should have a parent container for it to help with layout and positioning"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:16:40.605Z,"that parent container could be the BODY or a DIV or a TABLE, etc"
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:16:58.941Z,"alright i get it but, what if its inside a picture? for example
<img src=""chocolate.png""> do i include the class inside or outside?"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:17:54.701Z,"`<img class=""pic01"" src=""chocolate.png"" />`"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:18:21.467Z,"or 
`<img src=""chocolate.png class=""pic01"" />`"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:18:25.047Z,doesn't matter
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:18:46.984Z,class just needs to be inside the tag
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:18:55.492Z,same goes for ID
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:19:01.720Z,@CinnamonB check out materializecss.com
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:19:41.694Z,"it's a pretty cool, young ,responsive framework using google's material design"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:20:05.008Z,@Kinglwal And img tags don't have closing tags....you end an img tag with `/>` and not `</img>`
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T20:20:17.707Z,OMG @mwsteb thank you! This is definitely new. Is it similar to Bootstrap or Foundation?
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:21:19.990Z,"@metalhaze Thank you a lot man, you're actual really awesome!"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:21:25.823Z,"@Kinglwal Then in your CSS you reference the class like so:
```
.pic01 {
background-position:top;
}
```"
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:21:44.782Z,Thank you soo muchh :D
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:21:58.745Z,dot notation is for classes and # are for ID's
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:22:14.579Z,an ID would be `#pic01 { }`
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:23:02.938Z,ohh alright i get so you can use either ID or class for CSS?
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:23:17.762Z,yes but an element can only have one ID
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:23:41.598Z,yeah alright i understand thank you again
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:24:07.982Z,usually use ID to identify unique items that won't repeat or appear more than once and classes for things that will be needed repeatedly
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:24:40.136Z,"@CinnamonB in many ways, yes. I mean, it's similar to all the modern css frameworks, but includes many cool features and effects"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:24:44.552Z,and it looks soooo slick!
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:24:46.253Z,for the most part you will mostly always be using classes
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T20:25:59.738Z,"@mwsteb it definitely uses the new improved Google UIX and I kind of like it. Thank you again for introducing me to it. I'm going to read up on it, and that would become my new Go-To for responsive design."
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:26:08.391Z,so i use class for a group of elements and Id for just one
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:26:27.026Z,@Kinglwal yah
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:26:49.467Z,"@Kinglwal Once you have that down I would check out Psuedo selectors
http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Selectors/pseudo-classes/:nth-child"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:27:26.836Z,"it's still under heavy development, but I've managed to build a small site with it and had only a single problem"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:27:28.821Z,allows you to choose things by order they appear without having to name them all
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:27:51.643Z,"i.e. style just the first item, style all even items, style just the last item, etc"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:28:00.113Z,"which is probably fixed in the latest release anyway, which reminds me - I'm gonna have to upgrade to the newest version"
Kinglwal,2015-01-07T20:29:16.495Z,@metalhaze okay sounds goods :+1: 
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T20:29:44.724Z,"That sounds good, at least it's still in development. "
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:31:17.139Z,"well, currently at version 0.94, it's actually on the verge of becoming a mature framework. "
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T20:32:06.971Z,I can't wait to use it
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:35:00.543Z,:D
davisec52,2015-01-07T20:39:14.486Z,Say. could someone remind me how to format code for chat?

mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:41:39.474Z,"weee, starting level 5!"
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:41:47.924Z,you have that img just WAITING to be posted at any given moment haha
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:42:02.128Z,@mwsteb Right there with ya
iheartkode,2015-01-07T20:42:31.274Z,Yep on my bookmark bar
metalhaze,2015-01-07T20:45:53.982Z,is it javascript bookmark that automatically pastes it?
admhlt,2015-01-07T20:47:41.224Z,"@Kinglwal For the most part modern CSS usage just uses classes `.class` all the time, and almost never IDs `#ID`.
The one time using IDs is okay is if you are using them in HTML to define links within a page, but you shouldn't ever need to style them."
iheartkode,2015-01-07T20:48:26.911Z,No but that would be cool
iheartkode,2015-01-07T20:48:41.593Z,i just open and copy and paste
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:51:00.816Z,"I've found a real gem today, lads and lasses - for all of you subject to perennial suffering due to much too many tabs open I present to you - browser extension Tab Wrangler! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-wrangler/egnjhciaieeiiohknchakcodbpgjnchh?hl=en"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:52:58.567Z,"it closes open tabs that are idle for a specified time, thus saving a ton of memory; but it would suck if it was all that it really did, which is why it also gives you an access to the closed tabs and allows for easy restoration should you need it. BADA-BAM!"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:53:13.362Z,"sorry, I just got a little excited"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T20:53:58.204Z,"also, it's probably much much cooler than I'm advertising, but I've just learned about it today"
seahik,2015-01-07T20:56:18.783Z,@mwsteb wow that is pretty good idea...will have to try it out.  It would also be slick if the list of closed tabs had some sort of quick option to bookmark them
iheartkode,2015-01-07T20:59:17.959Z,I present a mix I made for your coding... http://www.mixcloud.com/lokidokie/manic/  if you like dubstep

davisec52,2015-01-07T21:00:57.843Z,I was wondering if anyone comfortable with javascript could help me out with some code I've posted in the help chat.
cerissa,2015-01-07T21:01:05.844Z,"so today i set out to start my portfolio website, if for no other reason then to get some real life experience in web designing. man i have a ton to learn still haha. but its fun trying to figure out how to make things work between html and css, i can only imagine when i add javascript or php haha. but spent the last 4 hours doing it so i guess i need to get up and do something else.

mwsteb,2015-01-07T21:01:16.628Z,"I've been listening to mostly mellow jazz-hop and been lacking energy lately, perhaps this will help"
iheartkode,2015-01-07T21:01:42.007Z,Indeed
cerissa,2015-01-07T21:01:42.085Z,@iheartkode i usually listen to smooth jazz for some reason i love it when im web designing
iheartkode,2015-01-07T21:02:12.424Z,"Jazz is nice, I listen to a large variety of music coding.. yesterday classical today Dubstep / Electro"
seahik,2015-01-07T21:02:31.670Z,"I was just watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iukBMY4apvI#t=597) that I saw on /r/javascript.  He screencasts making of a webapp with JSPM and ES6.  Its a bit advanced for me of course, but I still could follow along a bit.  I'm wondering if anyone knows of some good youtube channels that have screencasts of building a webapp from start to finish that are maybe on advanced beginner level?  It' cool to see things from start to finish."
mwsteb,2015-01-07T21:02:31.758Z,"yeah, it depends on the activity. I like to listen to electronic music when I actually know what I have to do"
cerissa,2015-01-07T21:03:15.145Z,ive never tried dubstep before i will have to try it out
iheartkode,2015-01-07T21:03:21.468Z,"This mix is varied, i have't made a mix in a year bad me."
mwsteb,2015-01-07T21:03:28.071Z,but when brainstorming or searching for an answer I prefer something with less rib-crushing bass
iheartkode,2015-01-07T21:03:39.610Z,Skrillix is not dubstep lol just a warning.

dannyclare,2015-01-07T21:42:54.176Z,"@seahik wow, thanks a lot  - still a work in progress, but that's v. kind!"
iheartkode,2015-01-07T21:43:17.109Z,Also you can star posts and find posts easier.
iheartkode,2015-01-07T21:43:33.503Z,Scholar lol no.
benstoltz,2015-01-07T21:43:52.415Z,Too late. You have been Scholared.

CinnamonB,2015-01-07T21:47:13.288Z,"@mwsteb Which route did you take, the standard or sass of MaterializeCSS?"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T21:51:52.740Z,"@CinnamonB I used middlemen for static sites, so I went with sass"
CinnamonB,2015-01-07T21:52:42.845Z,@mwsteb ok cool. I prefer sass well.
iheartkode,2015-01-07T21:57:23.303Z,Okay logging off to get some productivity going  :P
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:00:52.028Z,"is codeschool nodejs 6.3 bugged or is it my browser?
"
odrisck,2015-01-07T22:01:35.123Z,what problem are you having
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:02:44.892Z,"well, for starters, I can't modify the script tag so I can't add src attribute"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:03:13.641Z,"so I added another script tag, filled it with correct code, checked hints to be sure - but still nothin'"
odrisck,2015-01-07T22:03:26.247Z,hmm 
odrisck,2015-01-07T22:03:37.619Z,"I've not heard anyone else having a problem, let me take a look"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:03:40.056Z,"this is what I ended up with:
<script>
</script>
<script src=""/socket.io/socket.io.js"">
  var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');
</script>"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:04:49.858Z,still gettin' Incorrect submission: Don't forget to create the connection to socket.io on the server!
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:05:00.215Z,which I did
odrisck,2015-01-07T22:05:43.412Z,have you refreshed the page and tried again?
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:05:46.603Z,yep
sircharleswatson,2015-01-07T22:06:01.002Z,make sure you look over the slides again to see what they did/explained
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:06:32.169Z,"oh, i've managed to solve it, albeit solution is not easy on the eyes...
<script>
	var server = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');
</script>
<script src=""/socket.io/socket.io.js"">
  var server = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');

mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:06:58.115Z,not sure what's that all about
odrisck,2015-01-07T22:07:15.869Z,"oh good, cuz I haven't gottenthat far and can't see it till I do apparently LOL"
odrisck,2015-01-07T22:08:06.874Z,"but now that I've spent another email address, I should probably finish those up :)"
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:08:11.998Z,"oh, I see, they actually wanted me to create <script src='path'></script> above another script tag in which I connect to local server. nvrmind"

mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:50:21.497Z,"dang, finished codeschoool :<"
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:53:16.668Z,I'm so done with coderbyte
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:53:29.041Z,"not as in finished, but irritated"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T22:54:30.647Z,@Maximization why so?
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:55:19.257Z,silly problems that take ages to solve
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:55:48.131Z,@Maximization my sentiments exactly
allrightprimo,2015-01-07T22:55:54.151Z,hello world!! i just started today. so awesome having found this CodeCamp project!! im learning angularJS right now
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:56:23.264Z,reinventing basic functionality that comes with lo-dash isn't exactly the best use of my time
mwsteb,2015-01-07T22:56:39.371Z,"cool @allrightprimo, good to have you with us!"
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:56:41.958Z,"I'm able to come up with more complex solutions on other websites but somehow on coderbyte the simplest problems are a pain in the ass, makes you feel a noob"
allrightprimo,2015-01-07T22:57:07.157Z,@mwsteb cheers mate !!
benstoltz,2015-01-07T22:57:09.224Z,@Maximization Have you looked at Codewars at all?
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:57:19.707Z,yeah I like codewars much more
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:57:30.285Z,I'm just doing coderbyte for the sake of FCC
benstoltz,2015-01-07T22:57:34.365Z,yah
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T22:57:37.730Z,@Maximization have you tried codeeval?
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:57:59.082Z,"oh yeah, basically every other site out there is better than coderbyte"
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:58:21.039Z,FCC should get rid of coderbyte in their curriculum
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T22:58:39.098Z,Why do you think that is? Is it just the sillyness that gets to you?
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:58:57.832Z,"change it to like, complete at least 60 challenges of kata 8 or 7 on codewars"
Maximization,2015-01-07T22:59:33.663Z,"yes, I think that's the main issue"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T22:59:45.082Z,What kata level have you gotten up to in codewars @maxim?
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:00:00.642Z,@Maximization*
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:00:16.804Z,besides the annoying coding environment and lack of stories behind problems
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T23:00:46.517Z,The one thing I like about coderbyte is the ability to see others submissions…and then reevaluate how weak my code was in comparison (and how much longer it took me!).
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:01:07.277Z,@brndnb Codewars allows you to do that also
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:01:14.146Z,"@benstoltz I haven't gotten much into codewars, used to train at codeabbey.com before I recently heard of codewars"
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:01:31.102Z,@brndnb many other sites do a better job at that than coderbyte
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T23:01:35.406Z,@benstoltz Codewars is news to me. I’m checking it out right now.
odrisck,2015-01-07T23:01:41.642Z,"hello @allrightprimo welcome to our community, how did you hear about us?"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:01:47.218Z,@Maximization Have you looked at the higher level stuff? IE kata 6 and lower?
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:02:23.526Z,"just sneak peaked, haven't actually gotten my hands dirty"
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:02:24.482Z,why?
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:02:37.340Z,"They are, in a word, tough."
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:02:52.103Z,haha yes I figured
allrightprimo,2015-01-07T23:03:10.170Z, @odrisck  i tweeted about a website where im coding and learning angularjs and freeCodeCamp marked as fav. then i saw the website and joined
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:03:24.019Z,"computer science, algorithms and all that comes into play"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:03:33.162Z,oh yes
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:03:44.425Z,"abstract thinking, multi-level problem decomposition"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:03:53.521Z,genetic algorithms and ASCII85 encoding/decoding
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:04:00.895Z,image processing
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:04:03.930Z,analytical skills
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:04:18.464Z,"oh yes, niche related skills"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:04:19.909Z,Yeah. I’ve been very impressed by the site
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:05:02.068Z,"one thing is solving a problem, another is coming up with one"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:05:10.084Z,"I’ve gotten myself to 6kyu, but jeez…..it’s painful after that point"
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:05:28.227Z,"top 50 guys on that list could easily get to google and such, if not more"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:05:39.248Z,Oh of course.
zerhackermann,2015-01-07T23:06:24.484Z,almost. through. jquery....
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:06:45.218Z,"I’d say if you could do up to…level 7 or 6 kata just from your head, without google searching up the wazoo that you could comfortably fill a junior dev role"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:07:01.291Z,(since I’ve known many junior devs who would just freeze at that stuff)
john8801,2015-01-07T23:08:08.929Z,anyone want to pair on the coderbytes?
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T23:08:11.149Z,"@benstoltz just for my own clarification, are you referring to level 7 kata on codewars? I’m looking for a way to quantify my abilities once ready to appy for dev jobs."
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:08:47.780Z,"kata 6, 7 and 8 have 330 approves problems in JS"
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:08:59.964Z,"whole bunch, are they all unique though? must be"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:09:18.161Z,"I am @brndnb. But, I’m meaning able to solve them comfortably without too much research/googling. Being able to sit down and visualize the problem and it’s solution and plan the logic out to solve it on your own."
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:09:22.358Z,@john8801 what challenges you on? I'm doing mediums now
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:09:40.578Z,"@brndnb yup, you can definitely use this"
john8801,2015-01-07T23:09:50.922Z,"Oh, I'm still on easys -- about 1/2 way through"
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T23:10:13.046Z,"@benstoltz Ok. Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind. I’m not there yet, by any means, but it is another clear thing to strive for!"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:10:23.418Z, /nods
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:10:38.406Z,"@benstoltz that comes with experience though, remembering design patterns"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:10:59.689Z,That’s true @Maximization I might be overstating a junior role.
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:11:07.255Z,actually I probably am
brandenbyers,2015-01-07T23:11:38.181Z,Ooh! Codewars has Haskell too. Looks like I’m going to be distracted for a while...
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:11:45.818Z,hahaha
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:11:56.816Z,"@john8801 we could pair tomorrow, right now I just want to go through coderbyte as quickly as possible with some music one"
john8801,2015-01-07T23:12:44.278Z,Alright
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:13:00.339Z,"codewars should have brainfuck, that would be fun"
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:13:01.424Z,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
mwsteb,2015-01-07T23:13:13.372Z,"haskell! I was thinking about it for some time now, but then there's elixir! good grief, which one should I choose?!"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:13:51.273Z,oh god that language @Maximization 
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:14:09.938Z,"I just joined FreeCodeCamp I'm really digging it, im also a member of CodeWars! "
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:14:26.817Z,Welcome @AlexRincon9!
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:14:33.930Z,@AlexRincon9 cool website you have
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:14:46.737Z,@benstoltz Thanks!
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:15:27.818Z,"oh that's funny, I'm also majoring in finance in 2 months"
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:15:29.758Z,"@Maximization Thanks man, it was built using the Treehouse lessons, customized it a bit. I will be updating it soon to incorporate Material Design and better functionality."
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:15:44.796Z,Heyo Treehouse :D
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:16:30.814Z,@AlexRincon9 how about the projects in your portfolio?
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:16:33.654Z,"@Maximization Yeah man decided Finance and Accounting aren't the career paths I want to go down. I love tech and have been wanting to learn programming for awhile, last year I finally decided to take it seriously."
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:16:43.997Z,btw some links are broken
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:16:49.754Z,The projects in my portfolio are actual projects I have done. 
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:17:01.935Z,@AlexRincon9 exactly my life story
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:17:28.358Z,oh I see you made a portfolio for a friend
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:17:58.021Z,tabutsa.com and pltcetral.com are broken
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:18:16.911Z,"@Maximization Thanks for the catch, Tabu was an actual restaurant I opened at the beginning of college, it was bought out a few months ago."
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:18:24.874Z,ptlcentral is actually a typo hahahaha
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:19:07.740Z,@Maximization Feel free to connect with me on Twitter: @alex_rincon9
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:19:10.407Z,I used to own a restaurant?
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:19:29.143Z,"oh I will, would like to chit chat a bit more"
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:19:50.105Z,it's comforting to find other people in similar situations
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:20:12.282Z,"I actually don't have a twitter account yet, but will make one soon"
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:20:28.933Z,"@Maximization Definitely, not many people in my university that have the same path. haha I feel like a contrarian in my program. "
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:20:50.734Z,@Maximization No worries email is cool too
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:21:07.764Z,"I know.. but none of my friends and friends of my friends use twitter, not popular among econ students in my country, it's considered a hipster thing"
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:21:42.242Z,@AlexRincon9 go against the stream and you'll fly above and beyond!
4TSG4X,2015-01-07T23:21:47.924Z,Anyone here currently a comp science student?
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:22:45.500Z,"@Maximization very interesting. Instagram and Facebook are the norm over here. I like Twitter because it is a great way to keep up to date with tech, finance and other news. "
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:23:31.339Z,I can imagine twitter being a good source for that
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:23:45.430Z,"tambien veo que hablas espanol, muy bien"
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:24:10.611Z,do you have latin american roots?
AlexRincon9,2015-01-07T23:24:26.378Z,"@Maximization Si, soy Mexicano."

iyeager2004,2015-01-07T23:34:41.847Z,Deja vu.
pedromaltez,2015-01-07T23:36:07.651Z,"@iyeager2004 haha, no one answered, so I just asked it again, thought I might get lucky. idk who's in charge of the website. is it @QuincyLarson?"
iyeager2004,2015-01-07T23:38:00.077Z,@pedromaltez I think Quincy said before that there were lots of async loads going on that were starting to bog down as membership increased so he took them out. It probably got lost in the chat.

benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:53:10.610Z,"Oh @cshutchinson, guess how much the insurance adjuster valued the water damage from the other day?"
Maximization,2015-01-07T23:53:40.884Z,I'm curious too
cshutchinson,2015-01-07T23:53:43.512Z,how many square feet is residence?
cshutchinson,2015-01-07T23:53:51.638Z,roughly...
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:53:53.737Z,2k I’d guess?
teenagecamera,2015-01-07T23:53:58.708Z,It's gonna be fun. I've always enjoyed being ahead... lol 
cshutchinson,2015-01-07T23:54:04.005Z,"75,000 I bet"
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:54:14.528Z,so the master bedroom upstairs + bathroom
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:54:18.260Z,and then the whole kitchen
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:54:31.056Z,20 - 30k
cshutchinson,2015-01-07T23:54:32.982Z,i may be a bit high
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:54:39.997Z,So it could have been much worse.
cshutchinson,2015-01-07T23:54:44.835Z,yeah....
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:55:08.072Z,But on the upside they’ve been meaning to redo the kitchen for a while and this just gave them the impetus -_-
cshutchinson,2015-01-07T23:57:42.676Z,do they have everything dried out now?
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:57:59.745Z,another day or two and it shall be
cshutchinson,2015-01-07T23:58:13.936Z,at least this low humidity / cold temps will help
benstoltz,2015-01-07T23:58:22.640Z,"At least it’s not the jet engine fans, they have these new ones that are much quieter."

jordanw,2015-01-08T01:08:12.830Z,I just started getting the hang of it. Haha.
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:08:54.322Z,How does ejs compare to jade? I've only used jade but I kind of hate the whole indent or die philosophy behind it
jordanw,2015-01-08T01:09:17.274Z,I much prefer ejs/handlebars to jade.
jordanw,2015-01-08T01:09:52.462Z,Jade gives me errors at every turn. 
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:09:59.287Z,They're different right? I've used handlebars (which used to be moustache right?) a long time ago but not ejs
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:10:34.712Z,"Yeah, I love how clean jade looks but I do find myself fixing indentation aaaall the time"
jordanw,2015-01-08T01:10:48.124Z,Instead of using the indentation to format you just throw your code into html with {{}}
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:12:05.275Z,Is it not a problem that angular uses those same double curly braces?
jordanw,2015-01-08T01:12:30.934Z,That I don't know yet. Haven't used them together yet.
jordanw,2015-01-08T01:12:59.967Z,ejs uses <% %> so it might be alright.
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:13:31.950Z,"<% %>? That looks pretty baller, I'm gonna try that out later :)"

jordanw,2015-01-08T01:15:14.728Z,Ha yeah.
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:15:15.804Z,"Cool, based on that example it seems almost identical to jade but just symbols instead of indentation, I could definitely live with that, thanks"
jordanw,2015-01-08T01:15:20.965Z,Right
jordanw,2015-01-08T01:16:00.530Z,That's much closer to the phptemplate engine I've been using in Drupal for the last 6 years.
jordanw,2015-01-08T01:16:51.428Z,Most jade example I've found use spaces and I like tabs. You've probably run into that..
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:17:37.707Z,"Nah, no problems for me there, with tabexpand in vim it converts tabs into spaces"
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:18:08.064Z,I just keep indenting everything wrong so I'm definitely going to check out ejs

iheartkode,2015-01-08T01:24:30.800Z,right
Maximization,2015-01-08T01:24:32.555Z,there's always going to be people on this world who are better than you
iheartkode,2015-01-08T01:24:35.192Z,I avoid them
iheartkode,2015-01-08T01:24:44.387Z,I'd rather do Eloquent JS
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:25:00.921Z,"True, but i'd rather not have my nose rubbed in it so frequently :)"
Maximization,2015-01-08T01:25:05.890Z,@john8801 you're pairing yet?

Maximization,2015-01-08T01:37:58.472Z,the homework assignments gave me a bit of a headache on windows
Maximization,2015-01-08T01:38:08.530Z,window's shell is awful
Maximization,2015-01-08T01:38:56.624Z,"but I managed to get it to work, I'm now using cmder which even has unix commands"

RussEby,2015-01-08T01:41:10.469Z,"@Maximization I use the shell that comes with SourceTree. All the blogs list the Linux commands, so it does make if very confusing to jump back and forth from Windows and Linux."

greg-js,2015-01-08T01:44:39.537Z,"Oh, is Mongo doing a free course again?"

greg-js,2015-01-08T01:46:38.606Z,Thanks for the heads up :)
pedromaltez,2015-01-08T01:47:56.444Z,which one are you guys doing? the node one? the 'for developers' one?
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:48:11.319Z,I'm signing up for the node one now
john8801,2015-01-08T01:48:25.201Z,yeah node -- fcc for the win!
jordanw,2015-01-08T01:48:41.549Z,I'm doing for Node.js developers and for DBAs
cerissa,2015-01-08T01:50:25.627Z,im doing node one also
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:53:55.630Z,"Talking about online courses, did anyone here do the Linux course on edx? And if so, do you know if the new one that just started/is about to start is worth doing if I've already done the old one?"
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T01:58:55.663Z,was the old course worthwhile?
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T01:59:06.691Z,"I looked at enrolling in this offering, not sure"
greg-js,2015-01-08T01:59:53.931Z,"Yes I think so. It doesn't make you an expert but some sections had a lot more information than I expected (while others were a bit light on content), but overall definitely worth doing"
greg-js,2015-01-08T02:01:58.828Z,The videos were VERY low budget though :) but personally I prefer text anyway so..
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:02:08.864Z,i just signed up today for it acatually
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:03:10.283Z,good evening CodeCampers

Nocando,2015-01-08T02:20:00.869Z,I'm proud of myself right now... I'm actually reading.
benstoltz,2015-01-08T02:20:08.371Z,Ever so professional of them -_-
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:20:10.627Z,I was showing my granddaughter how to alter the pitch of her voice with the piano on garage band :)

Nocando,2015-01-08T02:21:34.014Z,"@jordanW nice, I play CSGO ^^,"
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:22:15.966Z,so question for everyone. when do you feel like your comfortable to move on to a new language. for instance im learning html/css and i feel pretty comfortable with it so im going to go on to javascript then php. then others.  but when do you feel comfortable enough to move on?
benstoltz,2015-01-08T02:22:40.142Z,Usually before I’m ready :P
jordanw,2015-01-08T02:24:42.467Z,@Nocando Nice. How long have you played cs?
Nocando,2015-01-08T02:24:44.479Z,"@cerissa I just moved on when I learned the basics. I'm currently in that state right now. Im not great at CSS but, I'm learning it as I go through things everyday. You won't learn everything so quickly. But, it's nice to have a grasp at a language before hand."
DavidII,2015-01-08T02:24:49.479Z,"This subjective @cerissa, like you had mentioned ""your comfortable"". The goal is to get your feet wet. "
Nocando,2015-01-08T02:26:30.425Z,@JordanW I played a little of 1.6 back then. Then stopped playing until I bought CSGO during the sales last month 
DavidII,2015-01-08T02:26:39.233Z,"I would move on, but also keep reading and playing around with HTML/CSS. If you do the courses in freecodecamp you'll know how to move around."
DavidII,2015-01-08T02:26:59.304Z,@Nocando I agree
hallfox,2015-01-08T02:27:18.765Z,I
Nocando,2015-01-08T02:27:27.649Z,@cerissa Someone told me to dive into whatever I want to learn. New material will always be uncomfortable. Just keep practicing then you'll gradually learn it :D
DavidII,2015-01-08T02:28:27.688Z,I am still waiting for the Ah Ha movement. Which hadn't happen yet.
Nocando,2015-01-08T02:29:20.474Z,"At the moment I haven't done the challenges in 2-3 days. I went off to study outside materials. I still feel uncomfortable with these languages. But, that's the beauty of coding. You'll always figure out new things everytime you code. It's like a wonderful gift box delivered to you everyday."
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:29:21.238Z,"thanks guys, i always feel like i am jumping into new things too fast, like i want to learn php pretty bad and javascript, and totally unrelated for the most part python. but i dont overwhelm myself. so ive stayed with html/css almost like a safety net"
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:29:28.436Z,"ahha moments usually come through use, not study"
jordanw,2015-01-08T02:29:29.561Z,"I'm not sure I ever had an Ah Ha! moment with html/css. More like ""Why didn't it work the same this time""."
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:29:36.781Z,"@cerissa things stick when I do them. There comes a point when you know the basics, but you still have to look concepts up to make them work, doing them right consistently comes from just doing it. So going through the challenges, I complete them andmove forward, and trust that the real learning will come as I'm working on actual projects, "
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:30:28.185Z,"also, that practice, keeps me in the mindset that, these thing change, all the time, and just knowing I know how to find out is what gives me confidence"
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:30:33.820Z,"thats me, i can watch a ton of videos but i have to do them a few times in ""real life"" in order for them to sticl"
Nocando,2015-01-08T02:30:48.369Z,"@cerissa I want to learn ruby on rails and javascript at the same time. But, I know myself to not do them at the same time. Just know that learning one language at a time is fine. I know you would like to rush things quickly, as do I. But, i actually caught on that programming is all about being patient and understanding yourself."
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:31:00.637Z,all lessons do is teach you enough to be dangerous
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:31:54.922Z,then you have to go out there and break shit :)
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:31:57.979Z,thats how I learn
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:32:04.452Z,smash stuff up and break it 
Nocando,2015-01-08T02:32:05.087Z,@odrisck I agree with what you said.
mikeelliott,2015-01-08T02:32:06.628Z,"@terakilobyte @odrisck I totally agree, the online classes build a basic understanding but only by applying to problems, challenges, actual projects does any of it really start to stick - kind of like learning a foreign language, you can take all the classes you want but conversation and writing are the only thing that makes you eventually fluent - bottom line is it's just hard work, plain and simple and constant learning - what makes the FCC model nice is you get guidance and support so you can stay focused on a few key things and get help when you need it."
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:32:18.928Z,big wall of text inc
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:32:23.072Z,"Three programmers were asked to cross a field and go to the house at the other side.

The novice programmer looks at the short distance and says, ""it's not far!. That will take me ten minutes""

The senior programmer looks at the field, thinks for a while and says ""I should be able to get there in a day"".  The novice looks surprised.

The ninja programmer looks at the field and says. ""Looks like ten minutes, but I think fifteen should be enough"". The senior programmer sneers.

The novice programmer sets off, but within a few moments, explosive land mines go off, blasting huge holes.  Taking him off course, and requiring him to double back and attempt the crossing many times. It takes him two days to reach the goal. Although he is shaking and injured when he arrives.

The senior programmer sets off on all fours. And carefully taps the ground searching for mines, proceeding only when it is safe. Slowly and meticulously he crosses the field over the course of the day. Only setting-off a couple of mines.

The ninja programmer sets off, and walks directly across the field. Purposefully and directly. He arrives at the other side in just ten minutes.

""How did you do it""?, the others ask. ""How come the mines didn't get you?""

""Easy"" he replies. ""I didn't plant any mines in the first place""."
Nocando,2015-01-08T02:33:28.502Z,@cerissa If you ever want to build something. You can always pair up someone that's here.
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:33:57.662Z,bingo
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:34:03.083Z,"through repeated practice we’ll learn not to plant mines (i.e. bugs, writing correct code the first time, and having a general idea of what to do)"
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:34:44.217Z,"but, you gotta go through a few mine fields you built for yourself before you get there :)"
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:34:54.464Z,"thanks guys, i appreciate the advice/opinions. :-)"
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:35:13.949Z,"when you start going ""oh hell no I am NOT going to put that there, I remember hitting that mine"" you know you got it :)"
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:35:15.493Z,yep
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:35:43.290Z,being told not to touch the stove is nowhere near as effective a lesson as touching the stove and burning the crap out of yourself
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:35:50.925Z,yup
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:36:02.954Z,@odrisck @terakilobyte  that is very true.
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:36:08.512Z,the school of hard knocks has longer lasting lessons :)
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:36:54.294Z,"so remember to ask yourself ""what did I learn"" when you come out the otherside bruised and bloody :)"
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:37:09.372Z,@terakilobyte  boy have i learned that in life 
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:37:22.165Z,ok well poo thats making me think of hitting up coderbytes tomorrow
DavidII,2015-01-08T02:37:23.791Z,:thumbsup: @odrisck  I agree
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:37:26.209Z,"in C, I’ve spent hours tracking bugs down that were the result of bad pointers that I stupidly introduced"
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:37:31.289Z,@odrisck i will deff remember that. 
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:37:59.956Z,"in JS, I’ve spent a day chasing bugs that were the results of typos or not fully understanding a feature of a library I was using"
Nocando,2015-01-08T02:38:11.821Z,Thanks for that short story :D
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:38:17.446Z,absolutely infuriating. But based on those error messages I know exactly where to look now
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:38:35.953Z,"yup, thats always the issue, my own typo or not understanding a feature of a library"
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:39:04.009Z,"oh, and the difference between map and filter"
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:39:17.890Z,that had me going for about 2 hours once
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:39:43.215Z,and sorting
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:39:49.974Z,in css its always position and width that mucks me up :)
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:40:58.382Z,"you’d *think* that `[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1].sort()` would result in `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` but it absolutely doesn't"
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:41:12.708Z,"i spent like an hour today trying to get image size for a background that was way to big to shrink to the size i wanted. i thought it was just me and my inexperience,"

terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:41:38.873Z,yep @john8801 !
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:41:44.997Z,that seems wrong
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:41:49.525Z,not at all
john8801,2015-01-08T02:41:50.242Z,know that from coderbytes
john8801,2015-01-08T02:41:58.405Z,it treats the numbers like strings
odrisck,2015-01-08T02:42:12.283Z,ahhh
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:42:19.796Z,"‘1’ comes before ’10’, but lexicographically ’10’ comes before ‘2'"
cerissa,2015-01-08T02:42:22.977Z,"oh i see why cause of the 1 in the 10, got it"
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:43:53.122Z,"little tidbit though if you aren’t using lodash, `arr.sort(function(a,b) { return a - b});` will do the job without a ton of typing"
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T02:44:16.310Z,and just switch to b-a for reverse sorted order

odrisck,2015-01-08T03:01:45.071Z,Hi there @AlecHansen 
AlecHansen,2015-01-08T03:02:09.323Z,"for making a UI out of an image, how would you guys do it? I have about 80 images and am updating the image maps in jquery then using an onclick function I wrote that passes the id of what part of the image map was clicked. Then it runs through a switch and case cascade for behavior. Does that sound reasonable? "
AlecHansen,2015-01-08T03:02:15.992Z,Each image is like 500bytes
AlecHansen,2015-01-08T03:03:15.921Z,"Also, with 80 500 byte images, is it ok to load them all in an array after document.ready() or is that bad practice? "
JimBry,2015-01-08T03:12:14.612Z,Ladies and gentalmen I just came across some resources https://gist.github.com/ericelliott/d576f72441fc1b27dace#required-reading-online-resources cheers!
mikeelliott,2015-01-08T03:14:14.965Z,"@JimBry This list looks awesome, thanks for sharing"
JimBry,2015-01-08T03:15:34.201Z,Right it even has Netflix movies 😂
cshutchinson,2015-01-08T03:18:36.554Z," @JimBry another bookmark, thank you :)"
iyeager2004,2015-01-08T03:18:42.282Z,Anyone using koding.com?
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:25:38.843Z,"nope, never heard of it. "
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:27:21.978Z,"i dont know if i can go away from sublime, i love it. haha but i will try it out though"
iyeager2004,2015-01-08T03:27:41.575Z,"It's a cloud based IDE, kind of cool. Just saw they have the ability to share your IDE with another koding member. Might be nice for pair programming."
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:28:26.380Z,"that would be cool, is it free? i didnt see any place that had pricing on it yet,"
iyeager2004,2015-01-08T03:28:31.713Z,"Never used sublime, but I read a review of this, sublime, and atom and it said they're all kind of inline. "
iyeager2004,2015-01-08T03:28:37.777Z,"Yep, totally free."
iyeager2004,2015-01-08T03:28:48.760Z,They have hosting services you can upgrade too.
iyeager2004,2015-01-08T03:29:30.941Z,"But the free account comes with a VM that's on with a 60 minute timeout so you can run stuff and actually have other people look at it, not just run it on localhost."
BenClist,2015-01-08T03:29:48.557Z,I use nitrous.io
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:29:50.289Z,"oh i just love sublime, i even bought it, "
BenClist,2015-01-08T03:29:53.448Z,similar concept
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:30:03.977Z,koding sounds like something i will deff have to check out
RussEby,2015-01-08T03:30:56.422Z,"@cerissa Check out Codeanywhere also, I like the Dropbox intergration. "
iyeager2004,2015-01-08T03:32:39.153Z,Codeanywhere looks cool. 
BenClist,2015-01-08T03:33:02.052Z,nitrous has really nice git integration and can deploy direct to heroku
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:33:27.011Z,"ooo codeanywhere looks really nice, i like you can use it in pair programming. "
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:34:54.685Z,i just signed up for codeanywhere
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T03:35:31.457Z,Good evening everyone :)
cameronchong,2015-01-08T03:35:43.319Z,Good Evening @ESOComputing :D
benstoltz,2015-01-08T03:35:45.561Z,Hey there @ESOComputing 
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T03:35:48.429Z,Hi @ESOComputing 
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:35:52.591Z,good evening @ESOComputing 
RussEby,2015-01-08T03:36:48.603Z,"When you create a VM, you can specify a git repository and it will automatically set it up. The VM can also be configured to the set of tools you want. So presto, create a VM with the tools and Repo ready to go! "
towwiow,2015-01-08T03:37:09.545Z,Hello everyone!
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:37:12.781Z,that is awesome!!
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:37:18.965Z,hello @towwiow 
cameronchong,2015-01-08T03:37:21.150Z,Welcome @towwiow 
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T03:37:25.896Z,Hey @towwiow 
towwiow,2015-01-08T03:37:32.538Z,"Been away a couple of days. Haha, Rescuetime has me bugging out about my productivity time lol"
cameronchong,2015-01-08T03:37:39.271Z,haha
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T03:37:50.731Z,"I'll be popping in and out, pushing thru the beginning challenges here so I can get into the stuff I have no experience with. :) Also working on the Javascript course at Codecademy. Ready to dive in... so ttfn! (Still in the middle of the CSS robot, great way of teaching css positioning and z-index. "
towwiow,2015-01-08T03:38:15.121Z,go get 'em @ESOComputing 
benstoltz,2015-01-08T03:38:21.249Z,so wait
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T03:38:34.938Z,;) for what? lol
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T03:38:39.540Z,@ESOComputing +1 on the robot. It was fun.
benstoltz,2015-01-08T03:38:40.229Z,"with codeanywhere free, you can only send 1 share to another user ever?"
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:38:55.745Z,"oh i dont know, "
towwiow,2015-01-08T03:39:18.907Z,"I'm sticking on these beginning challenges of jQuery for a little while, until I get caught up on the Complete Web Developer Course (javascript section comes before jQuery section) -- that's what I've been doing while away."
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:39:29.732Z, @RussEby  will know
towwiow,2015-01-08T03:39:31.177Z,@benstoltz - not sure either buddy.
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T03:40:05.366Z,@towwiow  ;) Will do. I've played with some jquery effects recently on my client sites. Nice stuff there. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T03:40:49.816Z,@brndnb It totally is fun. I think it'd be a fun way to teach code to teenagers. 
RussEby,2015-01-08T03:42:03.254Z,"@benstoltz I haven't used the share feature yet, but the option lets you chose if anyone with the link can use it, or just an address, and then you can choose if the people can edit or view."
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T03:42:09.037Z,"@ESOComputing I'd go even further, I think with the right set-up, and maybe a little simpler, it would be great for middle-schoolers! Get 'em while they're young."
benstoltz,2015-01-08T03:43:04.025Z,@RussEby The problem is…it seems like you can send an unlimited amount of shares to others….but…you can only send a max of 1 to each unique person.
cerissa,2015-01-08T03:43:15.187Z,goodnight yall im tired and headed to bed
john8801,2015-01-08T03:43:49.350Z,Are some of the medium and easy challenges the same thing?
john8801,2015-01-08T03:43:56.112Z,On coderbyte
BenClist,2015-01-08T03:45:03.341Z,think some of them are similar but they add an extra layer of complexity
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T03:45:42.059Z,@brndnb That's when I began using HTML
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T03:45:55.462Z,I was 12 or 13 and in the 8th grade. 
BenClist,2015-01-08T03:46:02.952Z,"such as the palindrome on medium asks you to ignore  punctuation and symbols, which you didn't have to worry about on easy"
john8801,2015-01-08T03:46:08.854Z,I'm 13!
john8801,2015-01-08T03:46:22.179Z,@BenClist ok thanks
RussEby,2015-01-08T03:46:30.256Z,"@benstoltz I went with Codeanywhere because of the ease to upload and download files into the VM, Dropbox is part of the file structure. I don't do much sharing, so I'm not sure about that. For sharing I normally use CodePen"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T03:46:32.764Z,@john8801 Awesome. Keep it up. 
benstoltz,2015-01-08T03:47:11.773Z,"fair enough @RussEby . I was thinking of it for pair programming, but for everyday use I have a nice workflow tied with github so /shrugs"
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T03:47:18.932Z,@ESOComputing I started a little earlier. But that was back before much javascript and before CSS. Then I got stopped making websites for a few years and came back and was scared off by CSS and Javascript!
RussEby,2015-01-08T03:49:05.751Z,"@benstoltz I'm glad there are multiple of these companies. They'll add features that the other have and everyone wins, which platform you choose."
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T03:49:07.183Z,"But oh, how much easier it would have been if I had simply kept growing my skill set along with the web. Looking back, it was so simple then. Now, someone starting out fresh has SO much to learn to get into web dev."
benstoltz,2015-01-08T03:49:57.488Z,"Honestly, I just use git by command line to interface with github. When I’m lazy I use Tower (which is an awesome program)"
benstoltz,2015-01-08T03:50:02.979Z,mac only though
odrisck,2015-01-08T03:55:14.764Z,"yeah I prefer git by commandline the programs just confuse me, from commandline I can see what I'm doing and where its going"
benstoltz,2015-01-08T04:02:01.720Z,"I will say @odrisck, if you want to use a program that Tower is amazinggggggggggg"
benstoltz,2015-01-08T04:02:13.831Z,but it does cost $$
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T04:03:09.898Z,"@benstoltz really? Better than command-line? I listened to a podcast interview a while back with one of the creators of Tower and I still couldn't quite see the benefit. But honestly, I still haven't tried."
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:03:29.691Z,"@brndnb Yes, that is true... I wish I just did it all and had focused my energy into computers... I got scared off thinking oh with the dot com boom and the future of tech, it will be too competitive for me to go into computer science. Instead I went towards medicine... now I realize that my heart has always been in computers... I started with commandline stuff at age 5 and hardware by 7"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:03:53.004Z,"my grandpa used to program in basic and then qbasic, he worked a bit with c++ too."
benstoltz,2015-01-08T04:04:10.016Z,"@brndnb Honestly it’s faster then command line. It keeps track of all my repos in one place, visually. It shows all the changes in a really nice visual way in the staging area, all the remote changes made, everything"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:04:31.791Z,He never could make the move to gui....
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:05:05.304Z,"Gave me all his visualbasic software when I was a teenager, but I was too preoccupied with chatting and music. LOL"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:05:25.616Z,Webdev is where it's at today. :)
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T04:05:30.201Z,"@ESOComputing I can definitely relate to your story. Although my concern was that I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life in front of a computer, AND i chose something far less practical than medicine in college: Theatre Arts."
benstoltz,2015-01-08T04:05:31.970Z,yarly
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:05:43.322Z,I wanted to minor in theatre. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:06:09.963Z,When I started at Davis I was premed with the intent to get a bioscience degree and minor in theatre. LOL
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T04:07:00.072Z,"@benstoltz Ok. I'll add it to my list of things to try out. If nothing else, it sounds like it might give me a deeper understanding of git in a visual way that I can apply back into the command line."
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:07:03.134Z,"Life's pulled me many different ways, but now I see the sun shining brightly on the correct path. :sparkles: "
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:07:16.574Z,:sparkles: 
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T04:07:30.579Z,"@ESOComputing Bioscience and theatre, in theory that sounds like a good overall balance."
benstoltz,2015-01-08T04:07:36.654Z,"I originally started college going for enviro science, with a focus on marine Science @ESOComputing "
benstoltz,2015-01-08T04:07:55.332Z,"I’m now finishing up a Geography degree, so yeah…I’ve ranged far and wide"
mxys,2015-01-08T04:07:57.747Z,"@ESOComputing I can totally sympathize with you! A lot of people discouraged me from getting into tech when I was in high school (parents in particular), so I went into a more ""appropriate"" field. But I'm much happier now that I'm spending more time coding again."
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T04:08:51.618Z,@mxys why didn't your parents think tech was a good idea?
benstoltz,2015-01-08T04:11:58.034Z,"to sleep I go, nighto all :)"
mxys,2015-01-08T04:12:35.911Z,@brndnb Love him to death but my dad is so traditional. He thought there were so many better fields to get into and didn't like the idea of his daughter getting into tech I guess.
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T04:16:08.826Z,"@mxys oh, yes, traditional. I wonder if ""traditional"" parents of the future (say 50 to 100 years) will consider tech-related fields differently?"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:18:34.914Z,@benstoltz  So I'm not alone. LOL Night
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:19:18.215Z,@mxys I feel I also kind was like oh I don't people to look at me and see an UBER nerd... even though I kinda sorta used to write equations and solve them for fun as a kid. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:19:56.904Z,Growing up has helped me to realize what makes me happy is what's important. No one else. 
mxys,2015-01-08T04:20:55.912Z,@ESOComputing Yeah :x There were only two other girls in my high school programming classes and we all got teased a bit by the boys. Lame high school drama
mxys,2015-01-08T04:21:53.233Z,"But yeah, you eventually realize it doesn't matter what other people say as long as you're doing something you love"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:24:17.094Z,"Yup. In the high school I graduated from the MESA club was basically myself, my boyfriend at the time, and a couple other friends. There were just 4 or 5 of us. That's why I think education is so important at an early age... just took my nephew to the library to play with their touchscreen computer today. "
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:24:28.842Z,Get 'em YOUNG. 
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:25:56.455Z,"Yeah life pulled me in so many different ways :), but I always come back to this"
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:26:32.334Z,"now I spend time each week on coding.org with my 6 year old granddaughter, going through the programming games with her"
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:26:44.283Z,"she LOVES it and is always asking if we can ""play coding"""
mxys,2015-01-08T04:28:20.276Z,@odrisck That's adorable! Sounds like she's pretty clever for her age already.
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:29:01.708Z,"she really is, took her twice to grasp the concept now she is opening the ""view your code"" browser so she can see what its really doing"
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:29:11.547Z,"its drag and drop code blocks, she wants to see the real code"
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T04:29:23.718Z,@odrisck That's awesome. Any chance you have an iOS device? Have you tried Hopscotch with her?
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:31:55.018Z,yeah we have several iOS devices here :)
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T04:33:39.482Z,"What do you think of Hopscotch? Is it interesting to a 6 year old? I'm sure things will have changed by the time my 2-year-old son is of coding age, but I'm collecting ideas now so I'm prepared!"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:34:16.645Z,@odrisck That is awesome. :clap: 
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:34:19.941Z,"we don't let the kids on the handhelds anymore, they have a bad habit of changing app layout lol"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:34:35.516Z,lol
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:35:37.490Z,"but coding.org is similar with the drag and drop, and she makes her own games"
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:35:48.749Z,"if I let her on my phone or ipad, I'm sure she'd love it :)"
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:36:12.288Z,"her favorite though is to send the angry bird in the wrong direction and make it blow up, repeatedly, for half an hour LOL"
mxys,2015-01-08T04:36:30.837Z,Hahaha. That's awesome.
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:38:46.927Z,Cute. 
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T04:38:55.064Z,(^ _ ^)
yaskyj,2015-01-08T04:40:21.495Z,"@odrisck You're talking about code.org, right?"
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:40:31.082Z,yeah thts what I meant :)
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:41:02.349Z,"she has an account, remembers her username and password without help"
yaskyj,2015-01-08T04:41:02.739Z,I went to coding.org... and it is spammy.
odrisck,2015-01-08T04:41:05.379Z,super smart kid
abe03,2015-01-08T04:49:30.683Z,"Hi, i'm wondering if the projects on this site use backend languages or is mainly javascript?"
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:49:50.752Z,JS front end and Back
cameronchong,2015-01-08T04:50:07.739Z,@abe03 nodejs backend
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:50:24.521Z,Nodejs is javascript on the server side
cameronchong,2015-01-08T04:50:33.927Z,yeah
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:50:47.179Z,"Express is the framework, angular front end "
jblosch,2015-01-08T04:51:02.073Z,"Wow, this looks like an awesome coding resource. I'm excited about getting started on the challenges."
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:51:08.608Z,One language front and back end. :)
cameronchong,2015-01-08T04:51:30.571Z,@iheartkode So is express to nodejs what .NET is to C#?
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:51:44.074Z,Yes also Rails is to Ruby
cameronchong,2015-01-08T04:51:50.983Z,cool
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:52:03.225Z,It makes working with nodejs way easier.
cameronchong,2015-01-08T04:52:19.747Z,Does express use the MVC pattern?
abe03,2015-01-08T04:52:20.807Z,oo cool! i'm about to start the odin project in which they use Rails for backend.
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:52:27.730Z,Yep
cameronchong,2015-01-08T04:52:32.870Z,Nice
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:52:39.099Z,Model views and controllers.
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:52:58.085Z,ruby is the backend language rails is the framework
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:53:10.601Z,Ruby is lovely 
Rybar,2015-01-08T04:53:10.691Z,anyone else doing the mongoDB course?
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:53:15.708Z,I am
sircharleswatson,2015-01-08T04:53:47.505Z,I am too
cameronchong,2015-01-08T04:53:59.075Z,Wow you guys are just steaming ahead
Rybar,2015-01-08T04:54:01.960Z,"I'm liking it so far, I want to know what tech they're using for their videos, notes appearing above their hand in overlay, pretty cool. "
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:54:22.176Z,It's a well thought out course.
abe03,2015-01-08T04:54:30.712Z,"So what if you want to be a front end developer, should you still learn a backend language?"
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:54:51.650Z,Well for some of us this is our ticket to a job and which we need asap lol
robcolella,2015-01-08T04:54:53.190Z,"@abe03 Yea, I looked at the odin project but wanted to keep everything js for simplicity so went with FCC instead :)"
robcolella,2015-01-08T04:55:24.990Z,One language to rule them all!
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:55:29.134Z,Yes
cameronchong,2015-01-08T04:56:05.155Z,@iheartkode Your dedication is admirable
abe03,2015-01-08T04:56:08.841Z,"@iheartkode so you mean this will get you ""there"" faster?"
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T04:56:15.838Z,"@abe03 A local dev here told me once that it's much easier to get a junior backend dev job, whereas front-end needs more skill and is more competitive generally. That's just one opinion though."
sircharleswatson,2015-01-08T04:56:25.449Z,@Rybar I think they are using a wacom tablet of some sort
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:56:49.178Z,JS will get me there faster
abe03,2015-01-08T04:57:22.432Z,"@brndnb mmm i had heard the opposite actually, you get hired faster as front end but backend pays better..."
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:57:42.981Z,backend by itself is hard to find these days
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:57:56.141Z,most coding jobs want you to know both.
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:58:11.567Z,or have experience in both. 
teddy-error,2015-01-08T04:58:35.172Z,Everybody's gotta be a unicorn wizard?
iheartkode,2015-01-08T04:59:08.675Z,front end = html css js  which is something any backend dev needs to know
abe03,2015-01-08T04:59:15.964Z,"@robcolella @iheartkode so by learning javascript it's really easy to learn node.js, is it much faster then learning javascript and then ruby on rails then? "
iheartkode,2015-01-08T05:00:01.007Z,Both are complicated and take time to learn..
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T05:00:03.447Z,"I know someone who's a ux engineer and he told me to go with javascript, php, and ruby."

iheartkode,2015-01-08T05:00:26.750Z,But I think wayy down the road I know JS will be around..

iheartkode,2015-01-08T05:01:04.572Z,JS gives you instant satisfaction and action.
iheartkode,2015-01-08T05:01:20.457Z,I came from Ruby and Rails.

iheartkode,2015-01-08T05:02:40.472Z,I would not put my money on PHP lol
cameronchong,2015-01-08T05:02:57.182Z,"@Rybar Of course if you're a small firm/team you probably don't have the resources, time, or work to have ppl full time doing either frontend or backend"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T05:03:19.881Z,It has it's uses. I think it's under-appreciated personally. I've been dabbling for quite a few years. 
cameronchong,2015-01-08T05:03:20.139Z,@iheartkode PHP is in high demand but it doesn't pay well

brandenbyers,2015-01-08T05:09:16.570Z,A large portion of sites using wordpress could be served just as well with static site generators.
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T05:09:21.628Z,Obviously. LOL. I don't see myself giving up PHP for my content management systems on my client sites though.

iheartkode,2015-01-08T05:11:33.452Z,Well
robcolella,2015-01-08T05:11:51.435Z,"Yea but if you build a site for a client and then hand it over to them and they know nothing about manually updating html content, a cms is nice."
Rybar,2015-01-08T05:12:18.581Z,"It's easy to hate on PHP but in truth there's just SO MANY legacy CMS's and forum platforms still using it, its not going away any time soon."
brandenbyers,2015-01-08T05:12:20.509Z,@robcolella that's what tools like Parse (for Jekyll) have the potential to be.

mxys,2015-01-08T05:31:09.057Z,The reason I eventually switched over to FCC though is because of the community. There aren't any current active groups for  javascriptissexy

mxys,2015-01-08T05:32:47.207Z,I don't think they differ enough for it to be a big deal which you use. But notepad++ is kind of the uglier of the three.
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T05:33:07.629Z,@AmmarAliShah I used that years and years ago if I remember correctly!
Rybar,2015-01-08T05:33:17.113Z,"@mxys I think the general idea there is that you can accomplish more quickly with a bit of jquery than with javascript re: a website/app.  JS is important for sure, but learning the tools to get you moving forward creating dynamic web content has been put first here"
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T05:33:17.122Z,But I always went back to notepad. LOL.

alexandruolteanu,2015-01-08T08:11:26.473Z,@frankmaina Force yourself to start and keep going. That's the only way for me.

Kinglwal,2015-01-08T11:23:37.196Z,@terakilobyte Don't forget the brain has infinite capacity -  plus i'm in my adolescence years which means large amount of pruning is occurring. I aim to have at a foothold of a subject to connect the synapses in my brain to prevent large dose of prunning. This means if some time in the future i would like to return to a subject i would have the cognitive ability to. Sorry late reply trying to finish coding this blog

AmmarAliShah,2015-01-08T11:25:41.554Z,I'm reading this ^
Kinglwal,2015-01-08T11:26:54.543Z,@teddy-error yes but the life span of a human is not at all long enough to fill it thereby it can be falsely claimed as infinite since no matter how hard we try to fill it all we can't
john8801,2015-01-08T11:27:20.877Z,yeah
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T11:27:50.962Z,"@john8801 ok, so knowing how many combinations you can have is an excellent start"
john8801,2015-01-08T11:28:12.406Z,what after that?
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T11:28:14.120Z,"so, what I’d do is simply start at the first element, and pick all combinations that involve it"
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T11:28:30.284Z,"once done, remove it, and start with the new first element, doing the same"
john8801,2015-01-08T11:28:43.135Z,Oh thanks! I think I got it!
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T11:29:07.303Z,"unless order is important and they’re counting 1,2 and 2,1 as separate"

terakilobyte,2015-01-08T11:29:19.502Z,that simplifies it

teddy-error,2015-01-08T11:32:43.853Z,"There are young people like @AmmarAliShah , there are original Apple II owners coming from different careers I think, there are San Francisco techies here, there are moms"
cshutchinson,2015-01-08T11:32:58.311Z,@serhiicss good morning to you; great hope you are
john8801,2015-01-08T11:33:00.517Z,"And then there are middle-schoolers, like me"
Kinglwal,2015-01-08T11:33:14.081Z,haha moms 
Kinglwal,2015-01-08T11:33:29.816Z,how old is @AmmarAliShah ?
serhiicss,2015-01-08T11:34:20.697Z,I think web development is a great opportunity for a mother. Specially for those who stay home with kids.
teddy-error,2015-01-08T11:34:39.610Z,Agreed
serhiicss,2015-01-08T11:35:02.605Z,They can make a few extra bucks while at home and also teach their kids programming :)
teddy-error,2015-01-08T11:36:06.982Z,I wish my parents had taught me to code!

teddy-error,2015-01-08T11:37:27.339Z,"I actually learned eventually that both my parents had taken college courses with coding, but they never thought to teach me growing up -___o"
serhiicss,2015-01-08T11:37:52.683Z,Learning to code is never late though.
teddy-error,2015-01-08T11:38:35.816Z,"If I ever have kids I think at least at some point we'd spend a summer on the computer making some simple games or something. It's a really good problem solving skill. It's like puzzles, but it enables you to kinda make your own puzzles if that makes sense"
serhiicss,2015-01-08T11:38:49.789Z,In Europe they teach coding senior citizens because of shortage of programmers.

alexandruolteanu,2015-01-08T11:40:49.731Z,Yeah but still...
serhiicss,2015-01-08T11:41:03.048Z,"And according to the road map, those who finished should have spent 80 hours/week learning"
serhiicss,2015-01-08T11:41:25.831Z,"Although, they probably knew some stuff before"
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-08T11:41:35.401Z,Well if you had some previous experience you can breeze through half of the curriculum
serhiicss,2015-01-08T11:41:47.055Z,"Like me, I have done Stanford CS101 a few months ago"

greg-js,2015-01-08T13:24:21.082Z,When would I ever find the time to read all that though :O
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T13:25:24.062Z,@Maximization The art of computer programming is considered by many to be the bible of computer programming
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T13:25:57.192Z,"if K&R is the bible to C, TAOCP is the bible to the fundamental idea itself I suppose"

clumsybot,2015-01-08T13:55:58.771Z,Does completing FreeCodeCamp give you some advantage if you're planning to enroll in a CS degree program?
cshutchinson,2015-01-08T13:57:41.118Z,@benstoltz just doing some work on challenge 29; 
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T13:59:10.239Z,@clumsybot getting ahead may give you an advantage in teh beginning
benstoltz,2015-01-08T13:59:21.499Z,yup :)
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T13:59:43.407Z,"but if the CS degree path is worth the money, everyone should be relatively equal as far as exposure. At the end it would fall to intelligence and talent"
clumsybot,2015-01-08T14:00:10.610Z,How much Math is involved in a usual CS course?
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T14:00:30.353Z,depends on what you define Maths to be
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T14:00:38.084Z,it’s an incredibly broad field
clumsybot,2015-01-08T14:00:49.169Z,"I'm stuck in between deciding whether to focus on my Math or my computing skills (e.g Programming, Linux)."
clumsybot,2015-01-08T14:00:56.710Z,For this year at least.
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T14:01:08.375Z,some of the greatest computer scientists were mathematicians
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T14:01:35.706Z,"but computer science does not a program make, necessarily"
clumsybot,2015-01-08T14:02:08.329Z,So you're saying CS has broadened itself to move beyond just programming?
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T14:03:00.860Z,CS isn’t just programming. It’s analysis of algorithms and data structures among other things
terakilobyte,2015-01-08T14:03:09.724Z,which is where math would factor heavily
clumsybot,2015-01-08T14:03:13.460Z,Ah okay.
rrashbull,2015-01-08T14:09:45.000Z,"can anyone help me complete this code: change the paragraph's solid black backgrounds color to a semi-transparent linear gradient. it should begin as solid black at the bottom, and end as 40% black at the top"
rrashbull,2015-01-08T14:10:13.135Z,i am trying different codes rgba from what i learned until now but nothing fixes it 
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:10:32.044Z,I can help
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:11:17.445Z,Please use the http://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Help chat to paste your code
Maximization,2015-01-08T14:15:40.532Z,"@figitalboy hey Michael, I wanted ask: is there any progress with the non-profit projects?"
Maximization,2015-01-08T14:16:02.767Z,or what's the procedure anyway
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:16:04.520Z,what do you mean?
Maximization,2015-01-08T14:16:36.909Z,how does one go from completing the FCC curriculum to start coding for a non-profit?
Maximization,2015-01-08T14:16:45.645Z,what are the steps inbetween
alexandruolteanu,2015-01-08T14:16:58.383Z,@Maximization I'm interested in finding that out too
serhiicss,2015-01-08T14:19:08.964Z,"As far as I understand, once you complete FCC, you let one of the organizers know that you are ready and he will assign one of the non-profit projects to you."
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:20:58.096Z,@Maximization Ah I see
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:21:41.757Z,"Yes, lots of progress happening this week. Quincy and I spoke for a couple hours last night on just that. We have 12 coders who have just finished the challenges"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:21:52.252Z,so roughly 6 of the 15 nonprofits signed up are being assigned this week
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:22:05.645Z,we have about as many nonprofits in the pipeline going back and forth in emails
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:22:29.576Z,all coders must finish the easy and medium CoderByte challenges before taking on project
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:23:13.602Z,"myself, you, your coding pair, and sometimes quincy will then meet with the “stakeholder” from the nonprofit to discuss the project, timelines and expectations, etc"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:23:34.341Z,Every coder who finished the challenges was sent a form asking their availability per week so that we can match them up appropriately :D
Maximization,2015-01-08T14:24:16.096Z,"nice answer, this clarifies some questions"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:24:37.675Z,"We can see when someone finishes the challenges, but it’s good to reach out and let us know you’re done so we can expedite that process. We are still working out the system so I’m open to any feedback"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:25:08.465Z,But the goal is to find you a solid portfolio project and help you through it. I am always available.
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:25:13.993Z,within 24 hours
Maximization,2015-01-08T14:25:37.639Z,"8 medium coderbyte challenges left.. dammit, any chance I could get the form as well so I can start with the rest of the group this week/next week?"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:26:23.934Z,Don’t look at it as a “group” thing. In fact it will be better to have a little breathing room in between pairs meeting with their nonprofits
Maximization,2015-01-08T14:26:32.070Z,"It's not that I want to start prematurely, it's more that coderbyte is a bit of a pain"
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:26:38.542Z,"If you’ve completed the challenges, you should be receiving a form via email"
Maximization,2015-01-08T14:26:47.264Z,alright
CodeNonprofit,2015-01-08T14:27:11.844Z,"in the meantime, since you’re close, you can feel free to take a look at the projects available at the trello"

jenthebest,2015-01-08T16:59:50.656Z,@QuincyLarson Did you remove the Stanford Databases mini-courses from the challenges?
cerissa,2015-01-08T17:00:43.167Z,thanks guys
johnstonbl01,2015-01-08T17:05:25.596Z,https://dribbble.com/shots/1873731-Movers-Logo-Design?list=shots&sort=popular&timeframe=now&offset=8 always appreciate a solid logo like this.
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T17:10:37.401Z,Traversing the DOM in jQuery is so translatable to CSS selectors. Clicks in my brain nicely. I like it. 
QuincyLarson,2015-01-08T17:12:39.847Z,"@jenthebest Yes, we removed them. Many code campers were complaining that they were not as high quality as our other challenges. Also, SQL isn’t as relevant since most new JavaScript development is done with MongoDB"
QuincyLarson,2015-01-08T17:13:16.179Z,@johnstonbl01 I agree - that’s a great logo.
jenthebest,2015-01-08T17:13:19.801Z,"@QuincyLarson aha. cool, just curious. "
QuincyLarson,2015-01-08T17:14:24.787Z,"@jenthebest You can still work through the course if you’re interested - it’s probably the best SQL resource out there. Unfortunately, it’s not very interactive, and the videos don’t necessarily prepare you for the SQL challenges that follow."
ESOComputing,2015-01-08T17:16:58.561Z,LOL. My 3 year old nephew likes the jQuery song. Score! LOL
mwsteb,2015-01-08T17:17:23.654Z,jquery song?
